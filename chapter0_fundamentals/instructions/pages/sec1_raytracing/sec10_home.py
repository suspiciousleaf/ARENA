## Introduction

Today we'll be practicing batched matrix operations in PyTorch by writing a basic graphics renderer. We'll start with an extremely simplified case and work up to rendering your very own 3D Pikachu!

We'll also be touching on some general topics which will be important going forwards in this course, such as:

* Using GPT systems to assist your learning and coding
* Typechecking, and good coding practices
* Debugging, with VSCode's built-in run & debug features

## Content & Learning Objectives

### Rays & Segments

This section introduces the key ideas and concepts in today's exercises, and guides you through some basic functions involving creating & using 2D rays.

> ##### Learning objectives
>
> - Learn how to create PyTorch tensors in a variety of ways
> - Understand how to parametrize lines and rays in 2D
> - Learn about type annotations and linear operations in PyTorch

### Batched Operations

In the next section, you'll extend your work from the first section to perform batched operations, i.e. operations over several different dimensions at once. 

> ##### Learning objectives
>
> - Learn about some important concepts related to batched operations, e.g. broadcasting and logical reductions
> - Understand and use the `einops` library
> - Apply this knowledge to create & work with a batch of rays

### Triangles

In the final section we move into the 2D and 3D realms, and build up to rendering a full 3D mesh as a 2D image.

> ##### Learning objectives
>
> - Understand how to parametrize triangles in 2D and 3D, and solve for their intersection with rays
> - Put everything together, to render your mesh as a 2D image

### Bonus

In the optional bonus exercises, you have a chance to learn about the `pytest` library, as well as implement some more mathematically complex forms of raytracing to get things like dynamic lighting & videos.

## Setup

Run these cells below (don't worry about reading through them).

```python
import os
import sys
import torch as t
from torch import Tensor
import einops
from ipywidgets import interact
import plotly.express as px
from ipywidgets import interact
from pathlib import Path
from IPython.display import display
from jaxtyping import Float, Int, Bool, Shaped, jaxtyped
import typeguard

# Make sure exercises are in the path
chapter = r"chapter0_fundamentals"
exercises_dir = Path(f"{os.getcwd().split(chapter)[0]}/{chapter}/exercises").resolve()
section_dir = exercises_dir / "part1_ray_tracing"
if str(exercises_dir) not in sys.path: sys.path.append(str(exercises_dir))

from plotly_utils import imshow
from part1_ray_tracing.utils import render_lines_with_plotly, setup_widget_fig_ray, setup_widget_fig_triangle
import part1_ray_tracing.tests as tests

MAIN = __name__ == "__main__"
```

<details>
<summary>Help - in VSCode, I get yellow line warnings under lines like <code>part1_ray_tracing.utils</code>.</summary>

This is because VSCode's typechecker doesn't know where to look to resolve local imports. To fix this, take the following steps:

* `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac)
* Start to type "workspace settings", and choose the `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)` option
* Add the following lines to the JSON file:

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/chapter0_fundamentals",
        "${workspaceFolder}/chapter0_fundamentals/exercises",
    ],
}
```

Make sure these are the only lines in `"python.analysis.extraPaths"` (the others should be commented out). When you're working on later chapters, you'll need to change this accordingly.

<details>
<summary>Note on <code>pathlib</code></summary>

We'll be using the `pathlib` library to define file paths. This is a more modern way of working with file paths than the `os` library, and is more cross-platform. You can read more about it [here](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/).

A major advantage of using `pathlib` rather than just relative path names is that it is more robust to which file / directory you happen to be running your code in. There's nothing more frustrating than failing to import or load a file, even though you can see it right there in your directory! Most of our code to load files will look something like this:

```python
with open(section_dir / "pikachu.pt", "rb") as f:
    triangles = t.load(f)
```

since `section_dir` is the name of the `part1_ray_tracing` directory, and forward slashes are used to define files or directories within that directory.
