# Rays & Segments

## 1D Image Rendering

In our initial setup, the **camera** will be a single point at the origin, and the **screen** will be the plane at x=1.

**Objects** in the world consist of triangles, where triangles are represented as 3 points in 3D space (so 9 floating point values per triangle). You can build any shape out of sufficiently many triangles and your Pikachu will be made from 412 triangles.

The camera will emit one or more **rays**, where a ray is represented by an **origin** point and a **direction** point. Conceptually, the ray is emitted from the origin and continues in the given direction until it intersects an object.

We have no concept of lighting or color yet, so for now we'll say that a pixel on our screen should show a bright color if a ray from the origin through it intersects an object, otherwise our screen should be dark.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/ray_tracing.png" width="400">

To start, we'll let the z dimension in our `(x, y, z)` space be zero and work in the remaining two dimensions. 

#### Exercise - implement `make_rays_1d`

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

Implement the following `make_rays_1d` function so it generates some rays coming out of the origin, which we'll take to be `(0, 0, 0)`.

Calling `render_lines_with_plotly` on your rays will display them in a 3D plot.

```python
def make_rays_1d(num_pixels: int, y_limit: float) -> t.Tensor:
    '''
    num_pixels: The number of pixels in the y dimension. Since there is one ray per pixel, this is also the number of rays.
    y_limit: At x=1, the rays should extend from -y_limit to +y_limit, inclusive of both endpoints.

    Returns: shape (num_pixels, num_points=2, num_dim=3) where the num_points dimension contains (origin, direction) and the num_dim dimension contains xyz.

    Example of make_rays_1d(9, 1.0): [
        [[0, 0, 0], [1, -1.0, 0]],
        [[0, 0, 0], [1, -0.75, 0]],
        [[0, 0, 0], [1, -0.5, 0]],
        ...
        [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0.75, 0]],
        [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0]],
    ]
    '''
    pass

rays1d = make_rays_1d(9, 10.0)

fig = render_lines_with_plotly(rays1d)
```

### Tip - the `out` keyword argument

Many PyTorch functions take an optional keyword argument `out`. If provided, instead of allocating a new tensor and returning that, the output is written directly to the `out` tensor.

If you used `torch.arange` or `torch.linspace` above, try using the `out` argument. Note that a basic indexing expression like `rays[:, 1, 1]` returns a view that shares storage with `rays`, so writing to the view will modify `rays`. You'll learn more about views later today.

## Ray-Object Intersection

Suppose we have a line segment defined by points $L_1$ and $L_2$. Then for a given ray, we can test if the ray intersects the line segment like so:

- Supposing both the ray and line segment were infinitely long, solve for their intersection point.
- If the point exists, check whether that point is inside the line segment and the ray. 

Our camera ray is defined by the origin $O$ and direction $D$ and our object line is defined by points $L_1$ and $L_2$.

We can write the equations for all points on the camera ray as $R(u)=O +u D$ for $u \in [0, \infty)$ and on the object line as $O(v)=L_1+v(L_2 - L_1)$ for $v \in [0, 1]$.

The following interactive widget lets you play with this parameterization of the problem. Run the cells one after another:


```python
fig = setup_widget_fig_ray()
display(fig)

@interact
def response(seed=(0, 10, 1), v=(-2.0, 2.0, 0.01)):
    t.manual_seed(seed)
    L_1, L_2 = t.rand(2, 2)
    P = lambda v: L_1 + v * (L_2 - L_1)
    x, y = zip(P(-2), P(2))
    with fig.batch_update(): 
        fig.data[0].update({"x": x, "y": y}) 
        fig.data[1].update({"x": [L_1[0], L_2[0]], "y": [L_1[1], L_2[1]]}) 
        fig.data[2].update({"x": [P(v)[0]], "y": [P(v)[1]]})

```

Setting the line equations from above equal gives the solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}O + u D &= L_1 + v(L_2 - L_1) \\ u D - v(L_2 - L_1) &= L_1 - O  \\ \begin{pmatrix} D_x & (L_1 - L_2)_x \\ D_y & (L_1 - L_2)_y \\ \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} u \\ v \\ \end{pmatrix} &=  \begin{pmatrix} (L_1 - O)_x \\ (L_1 - O)_y \\ \end{pmatrix} \end{aligned}
$$

Once we've found values of $u$ and $v$ which satisfy this equation, if any (the lines could be parallel) we just need to check that $u \geq 0$ and $v \in [0, 1]$.


### Exercise - which segments intersect with the rays?

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µâšªâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```
 
For each of the following segments, which camera rays from earlier intersect? You can do this by inspection or using `render_lines_with_plotly`.


```python
segments = t.tensor([
    [[1.0, -12.0, 0.0], [1, -6.0, 0.0]], 
    [[0.5, 0.1, 0.0], [0.5, 1.15, 0.0]], 
    [[2, 12.0, 0.0], [2, 21.0, 0.0]]
])
```

<details>
<summary>Solution - intersecting rays</summary>

Run the following code to visualize the rays and segments:

```python
render_lines_with_plotly(rays1d, segments)
```

- Segment 0 intersects the first two rays.
- Segment 1 doesn't intersect any rays.
- Segment 2 intersects the last two rays. Computing `rays * 2` projects the rays out to `x=1.5`. Remember that while the plot shows rays as line segments, rays conceptually extend indefinitely.

### Exercise - implement `intersect_ray_1d`

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšª

You should spend up to 20-25 minutes on this exercise.

It involves some of today's core concepts: tensor manipulation, linear operations, etc.
```

Using [`torch.lingalg.solve`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.linalg.solve.html) and [`torch.stack`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.stack.html), implement the `intersect_ray_1d` function to solve the above matrix equation.

<details>
<summary>Aside - difference between stack and concatenate</summary>

`torch.stack` will combine tensors along a new dimension.

```python
>>> t.stack([t.ones(2, 2), t.zeros(2, 2)], dim=0)
tensor([[[1., 1.],
         [1., 1.]],

        [[0., 0.],
         [0., 0.]]])
```

`torch.concat` (alias `torch.cat`) will combine tensors along an existing dimension.

```python
>>> t.cat([t.ones(2, 2), t.zeros(2, 2)], dim=0)
tensor([[1., 1.], 
        [1., 1.],
        [0., 0.],
        [0., 0.]])
```

Here, you should use `torch.stack` to construct e.g. the matrix on the left hand side, because you want to combine the vectors $D$ and $L_1 - L_2$ to make a matrix.

Is it possible for the solve method to fail? Give a sample input where this would happen.

<details>
<summary>Answer - Failing Solve</summary>

If the ray and segment are exactly parallel, then the solve will fail because there is no solution to the system of equations. For this function, handle this by catching the exception and returning False.
</details>


```python
def intersect_ray_1d(ray: t.Tensor, segment: t.Tensor) -> bool:
    '''
    ray: shape (n_points=2, n_dim=3)  # O, D points
    segment: shape (n_points=2, n_dim=3)  # L_1, L_2 points

    Return True if the ray intersects the segment.
    '''
    pass


tests.test_intersect_ray_1d(intersect_ray_1d)
tests.test_intersect_ray_1d_special_case(intersect_ray_1d)
```

<details>
<summary>Help! My code is failing with a 'must be batches of square matrices' exception.</summary>

Our formula only uses the x and y coordinates - remember to discard the z coordinate for now. 

It's good practice to write asserts on the shape of things so that your asserts will fail with a helpful error message. In this case, you could assert that the `mat` argument is of shape (2, 2) and the `vec` argument is of shape (2,). Also, see the aside below on typechecking.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Note the use of `.item()` at the end. This converts a scalar PyTorch tensor into a Python scalar.
```python
def intersect_ray_1d(ray: t.Tensor, segment: t.Tensor) -> bool:
    '''
    ray: shape (n_points=2, n_dim=3)  # O, D points
    segment: shape (n_points=2, n_dim=3)  # L_1, L_2 points

    Return True if the ray intersects the segment.
    '''
    # SOLUTION
    # Get the x and y coordinates (ignore z)
    ray = ray[..., :2]
    segment = segment[..., :2]

    # Ray is [[Ox, Oy], [Dx, Dy]]
    O, D = ray
    # Segment is [[L1x, L1y], [L2x, L2y]]
    L_1, L_2 = segment

    # Create matrix and vector, and solve equation
    mat = t.stack([D, L_1 - L_2], dim=-1)
    vec = L_1 - O

    # Solve equation (return False if no solution)
    try:
        sol = t.linalg.solve(mat, vec)
    except RuntimeError:
        return False

    # If there is a solution, check the soln is in the correct range for there to be an intersection
    u = sol[0].item()
    v = sol[1].item()
    return (u >= 0.0) and (v >= 0.0) and (v <= 1.0)
```

### Aside - typechecking


Typechecking is a useful habit to get into. It's not strictly necessary, but it can be a great help when you're debugging.

One good way to typecheck in PyTorch is with the `jaxtyping` library. In this library, we can use objects like `Float`, `Int`, `Bool`, etc object to specify the shape and data type of a tensor (or `Shaped` if we don't care about the data type).

In its simplest form, this just behaves like a fancier version of a docstring or comment (signalling to you, as well as any readers, what the size of objects should be). But you can also use the `typeguard` library to strictly enforce the type signatures of your inputs and outputs. For instance, consider the following typechecked function:


```python
from jaxtyping import Float, Int, Bool, Shaped, jaxtyped
import typeguard
from torch import Tensor

@jaxtyped
@typeguard.typechecked
def my_concat(x: Float[Tensor, "a1 b"], y: Float[Tensor, "a2 b"]) -> Float[Tensor, "a1+a2 b"]:
    return t.concat([x, y], dim=0)

x = t.ones(3, 2)
y = t.randn(4, 2)
z = my_concat(x, y)
```


This cell will run without error, because the tensor `t.concat([x, y], dim=0)` has shape `(3+4, 2) = (7, 2)`, which agrees with the symbolic representation of `(a1 b), (a2 b) -> (a1+a2, b)` in the type signature. But this code will fail if the type signatures are violated in any way, for instance:

* `x` or `y` are not 2D tensors
* The last dimension of `x` and `y` doesn't match
* The output doesn't have shape `(x.shape[0] + y.shape[0], x.shape[1])`
* `x`, `y` or the output are of type int rather than type float

You can test these out for yourself, by changing the cell above and then re-running it.

Jaxtyping has many other useful features, for example:

* Generic tensors can be represented with `Float[Tensor, "..."]`
* Tensors with a single scalar value can be represented with `Float[Tensor, ""]`
* Fixed dimensions can be represented with numbers, e.g. `Float[Tensor, "a b 4"]`
* Dimensions can be named *and* fixed, e.g. `x: Float[Tensor, "b=3"], y: Float[Tensor, "b"]` will raise an error if `x` and `y` don't *both* have shape `(3,)`
* You can even use these objects for inline assert statements, e.g. `assert isinstance(x, Float[Tensor, "3 b"])` asserts that `x` is a 2D tensor of type float, with first dimension `3`.

You can find more features of jaxtyping [here](https://docs.kidger.site/jaxtyping/).

Overall, type-checking is a really useful tool to have at your disposal, because it can help you quickly catch bugs in your code (and it helps your code be explicit and readable, both to possible collaborators / pair programming partners, and to your future self!). 

We won't enforce strict typechecking in general, but you should feel free to use it when you're writing or using functions. (It's usually more useful when you're in the development stage, rather than once you're already confident that a function works correctly and will always receive the correct inputs.)


Exercise - can you rewrite the function `intersect_ray_1d` to use typechecking?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Your typechecked function might look like:

```python
@jaxtyped
@typeguard.typechecked
def intersect_ray_1d(ray: Float[Tensor, "points=2 dim=3"], segment: Float[Tensor, "points=2 dim=3"]) -> bool:
    '''
    ray: O, D points
    segment: L_1, L_2 points

    Return True if the ray intersects the segment.
    '''
```

This is if your solution just returned a boolean. If you left your boolean as a single-element PyTorch tensor, then a return type of `Bool[Tensor, ""]` would be appropriate.
