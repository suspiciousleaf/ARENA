# Triangles

## Triangle Coordinates

The area inside a triangle can be defined by three (non-collinear) points $A$, $B$ and $C$, and can be written algebraically as a **convex combination** of those three points:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(w, u, v) &= wA + uB + vC \quad\quad \\
    \\
s.t. \quad 0 &\leq w,u,v \\
1 &= w + u + v
\end{align*}
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
\begin{align*}
\quad\quad\quad\quad P(u, v) &= (1 - u - v)A + uB + vC \\
&= A + u(B - A) + v(C - A) \\
\\
s.t. \quad 0 &\leq u,v \\
u + v &\leq 1
\end{align*}
$$

These $u, v$ are called "barycentric coordinates".

If we remove the bounds on $u$ and $v$, we get an equation for the plane containing the triangle. Play with the widget to understand the behavior of $u, v$.


```python
one_triangle = t.tensor([[0, 0, 0], [3, 0.5, 0], [2, 3, 0]])
A, B, C = one_triangle
x, y, z = one_triangle.T

fig = setup_widget_fig_triangle(x, y, z)
    
@interact(u=(-0.5, 1.5, 0.01), v=(-0.5, 1.5, 0.01))
def response(u=0.0, v=0.0):
    P = A + u * (B - A) + v * (C - A)
    fig.data[2].update({"x": [P[0]], "y": [P[1]]})

display(fig)
```

### Triangle-Ray Intersection

Given a ray with origin $O$ and direction $D$, our intersection algorithm will consist of two steps:

- Finding the intersection between the line and the plane containing the triangle, by solving the equation $P(u, v) = P(s)$;
- Checking if $u$ and $v$ are within the bounds of the triangle.

Expanding the equation $P(u, v) = P(s)$, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
A + u(B - A) + v(C - A) &= O + sD \\ 
\Rightarrow
\begin{pmatrix}
    -D & (B - A) & (C - A) \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 
    s \\ 
    u \\ 
    v  
\end{pmatrix}
&= \begin{pmatrix} O - A \end{pmatrix} \\
\Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 
    -D_x & (B - A)_x & (C - A)_x \\
    -D_y & (B - A)_y & (C - A)_y \\ 
    -D_z & (B - A)_z & (C - A)_z \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    s \\ 
    u \\ 
    v  
\end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix}
    (O - A)_x \\ 
    (O - A)_y \\ 
    (O - A)_z \\ 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
$$

We can therefore find the coordinates `s`, `u`, `v` of the intersection point by solving the linear system above.


### Exercise - implement `triangle_ray_intersects`

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

Using `torch.linalg.solve` and `torch.stack`, implement `triangle_ray_intersects(A, B, C, O, D)`.

A few tips:

* If you have a 0-dimensional tensor with shape `()` containing a single value, use the `item()` method to convert it to a plain Python value.
* If you have a tensor of shape `tensor.shape = (3, ...)`, then you can unpack it along the first dimension into three separate tensors the same way that you'd unpack a normal python list: `s, u, v = tensor`.
    * Note - if the dimension you want to unpack isn't at the start, a nice alternative is `s, u, v = tensor.unbind(dim)`, which does the same thing but along the dimension given by `dim` rather than the first dimension.
* If your function isn't working, try making a simple ray and triangle with nice round numbers where you can work out manually if it should intersect or not, then debug from there.


```python
Point = Float[Tensor, "points=3"]

@jaxtyped
@typeguard.typechecked
def triangle_ray_intersects(A: Point, B: Point, C: Point, O: Point, D: Point) -> bool:
    '''
    A: shape (3,), one vertex of the triangle
    B: shape (3,), second vertex of the triangle
    C: shape (3,), third vertex of the triangle
    O: shape (3,), origin point
    D: shape (3,), direction point

    Return True if the ray and the triangle intersect.
    '''
    pass

        O - A
    )
    return ((u >= 0) & (v >= 0) & (u + v <= 1)).item()
```
</details>


## Single-Triangle Rendering

Implement `raytrace_triangle` using only one call to `torch.linalg.solve`. 

Reshape the output and visualize with `plt.imshow`. It's normal for the edges to look pixelated and jagged - using a small number of pixels is a good way to debug quickly. 

If you think it's working, increase the number of pixels and verify that it looks less pixelated at higher resolution.


### Views and Copies

It's critical to know when you are making a copy of a `Tensor`, versus making a view of it that shares the data with the original tensor. It's preferable to use a view whenever possible to avoid copying memory unnecessarily. On the other hand, modifying a view modifies the original tensor which can be unintended and surprising. Consult [the documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_view.html) if you're unsure if a function returns a view. A short reference of common functions:

- `torch.expand`: always returns a view
- `torch.view`: always returns a view
- `torch.detach`: always returns a view
- `torch.repeat`: always copies
- `torch.clone`: always copies
- `torch.flip`: always copies (different than numpy.flip which returns a view)
- `torch.tensor`: always copies, but PyTorch recommends using `.clone().detach()` instead.
- `torch.Tensor.contiguous`: returns self if possible, otherwise a copy
- `torch.transpose`: returns a view if possible, otherwise (sparse tensor) a copy
- `torch.reshape`: returns a view if possible, otherwise a copy
- `torch.flatten`: returns a view if possible, otherwise a copy (different than numpy.flatten which returns a copy)
- `einops.repeat`: returns a view if possible, otherwise a copy
- `einops.rearrange`: returns a view if possible, otherwise a copy
- Basic indexing returns a view, while advanced indexing returns a copy.


### Storage Objects

Calling `storage()` on a `Tensor` returns a Python object wrapping the underlying C++ array. This array is 1D regardless of the dimensionality of the `Tensor`. This allows you to look inside the `Tensor` abstraction and see how the actual data is laid out in RAM.

Note that a new Python wrapper object is generated each time you call `storage()`, and both `x.storage() == x.storage()` and `x.storage() is x.storage()` evaluates to False.

If you want to check if two `Tensor`s share an underlying C++ array, you can compare their `storage().data_ptr()` fields. This can be useful for debugging.


### `Tensor._base`

If `x` is a view, you can access the original `Tensor` with `x._base`. This is an undocumented internal feature that's useful to know. Consider the following code:

```python
x = t.zeros(1024*1024*1024)
y = x[0]
del x
```

Here, `y` was created through basic indexing, so `y` is a view and `y._base` refers to `x`. This means `del x` won't actually deallocate the 4GB of memory, and that memory will remain in use which can be quite surprising. `y = x[0].clone()` would be an alternative here that does allow reclaiming the memory.


### Exercise - implement `raytrace_triangle`

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšª

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise.

This is about as hard as `intersect_rays_1d`, although hopefully you should find it more familiar.
```

Below, you should implement `raytrace_triangle`, a funtion which checks whether each ray in `ray` intersects a single given triangle.


```python
def raytrace_triangle(
    rays: Float[Tensor, "nrays rayPoints=2 dims=3"],
    triangle: Float[Tensor, "trianglePoints=3 dims=3"]
) -> Bool[Tensor, "nrays"]:
    '''
    For each ray, return True if the triangle intersects that ray.
    '''
    pass


A = t.tensor([1, 0.0, -0.5])
B = t.tensor([1, -0.5, 0.0])
C = t.tensor([1, 0.5, 0.5])
num_pixels_y = num_pixels_z = 15
y_limit = z_limit = 0.5

# Plot triangle & rays
test_triangle = t.stack([A, B, C], dim=0)
rays2d = make_rays_2d(num_pixels_y, num_pixels_z, y_limit, z_limit)
triangle_lines = t.stack([A, B, C, A, B, C], dim=0).reshape(-1, 2, 3)
render_lines_with_plotly(rays2d, triangle_lines)

# Calculate and display intersections
intersects = raytrace_triangle(rays2d, test_triangle)
img = intersects.reshape(num_pixels_y, num_pixels_z).int()
imshow(img, origin="lower", width=600, title="Triangle (as intersected by rays)")
```

    # SOLUTION

    assert A.shape == (NR, 3)

    # Each element of `rays` is [[Ox, Oy, Oz], [Dx, Dy, Dz]]
    O, D = rays.unbind(dim=1)
    assert O.shape == (NR, 3)

    # Define matrix on left hand side of equation

    # Get boolean of where matrix is singular, and replace it with the identity in these positions
    # Note - this works because mat[is_singular] has shape (NR_where_singular, 3, 3), so we
    # can broadcast the identity matrix to that shape.
    dets: Float[Tensor, "NR"] = t.linalg.det(mat)
    is_singular = dets.abs() < 1e-8
    mat[is_singular] = t.eye(3)

    vec = O - A

    # Solve eqns
    sol: Float[Tensor, "NR 3"] = t.linalg.solve(mat, vec)
    s, u, v = sol.unbind(dim=-1)

    # Return boolean of (matrix is nonsingular, and solution is in correct range implying intersection)
    return ((u >= 0) & (v >= 0) & (u + v <= 1) & ~is_singular)

## Debugging


Debugging code is an extremely important thing to learn. Just like using GPT to assist your coding, it's something that can significantly speedrun your development, and stop you getting hung up on all the frustrating things!

To give you practice debugging using VSCode's built-in debugger\*, we've provided an example function below. This is an implementation of `raytrace_triangle` which has a few mistakes in it. Your task is to use the debugger to find the mistake and fix it. (Note - you're encouraged to actually use the debugger, rather than comparing it to the solution above!)

def raytrace_triangle_with_bug(

    triangle: Float[Tensor, "trianglePoints=3 dims=3"]
) -> Bool[Tensor, "nrays"]:
    '''
    For each ray, return True if the triangle intersects that ray.
    '''
    NR = rays.size[0]

    A, B, C = einops.repeat(triangle, "pts dims -> pts NR dims", NR=NR)

    vec = O - A

You can debug a cell by clicking on the **Debug cell** option at the bottom of your cell. Your cell should contain the code that is actually run to cause an error (rather than needing to contain the function which is the source of the error). Before you run your debugger, you can set breakpoints by clicking on the left-hand side of the line number (a red dot will appear). You can then step through your code, using the toolbar of buttons which will appear when you run the debugger (see [here](https://pawelgrzybek.com/continue-step-over-step-into-and-step-out-actions-in-visual-studio-code-debugger-explained/) for an explanation of what each of the buttons does). When you reach a breakpoint, you can use the following tools:

* Inspect local and global variables, in the **VARIABLES** window that appears on the left sidebar.
* Add variables expressions to watch, in the **WATCH** window that appears on the left sidebar.
    * You can just type in any expression here, e.g. the type of a variable or the length of a list, and this will update as you step through the function.
* Evaluate expressions on a one-time basis, by typing them into the **DEBUG CONSOLE** (which appears at the bottom of the screen)

Note, when you run the debugger, it will stop *before* the breakpoint line is evaluated. So if you've run a cell and got an error on a specific line, then *that* is the line you want to set a breakpoint on.

*This all works basically the same if you're in a notebook in VSCode, except for a few changes e.g. the debug button is on the dropdown at the top-left of the cell (if it doesn't appear for you then you'll need to go into user settings and add the line `"notebook.consolidatedRunButton": true`).*

There's much more detail we could go into about debugging, but this will suffice for most purposes. It's generally a much more efficient way of debugging than using print statements or asserts (although these can also be helpful in some situations).

<details>
<summary>Answer - what are the bugs, and how can they be fixed?</summary>

```python
NR = rays.size[0]
```

This should be `rays.size(0)` (or equivalently, `rays.shape[0]`). `size` is a method which takes an int and returns the size of that dimension; `shape` returns a `torch.Size` object which can be indexed into.

This would have been pretty easy to realise without using the debugger, because the error message is informative.

```python
O, D = rays.unbind(-1)
```

We're unbinding from the wrong dimension. `rays` has shape `(nrays, points=2, dims=3)`, and we actually want to unbind along the `points` dimension. So we should use `rays.unbind(1)`.

We could have found this by inspecting the `rays` object in the variables pane (you can click on the dropdown next to the variable name to look at its attributes, including `shape`), or you could just type `rays.shape` into the debug console. However, this error should also have been apparent given the type signature of the function (a good case for using typing!).

```python
mat = t.stack([- D, B - A, C - A])
```

This should have had the argument `dim=-1` on the end, because `torch.stack` by default stacks along the first dimension.

This error is a bit harder to diagnose, because the line causing an error is after the line containing the mistake. Again, we could have diagnosed this with the debugger by inspecting the shape of our `mat` tensor in the variables pane.

---

These were all relatively easy bugs to diagnose (not all bugs will present as actual errors in your code, some might just be an unexpected set of results). But hopefully this has given you a sense for how to use the debugger. It's a very powerful tool, and can save you a lot of time!
</details>

\**If you're using Colab, you'll have to use different strategies for debugging. See [this page](https://zohaib.me/debugging-in-google-collab-notebook/) for one suggested approach.*

## Mesh Loading

Use the given code to load the triangles for your Pikachu. By convention, files written with `torch.save` end in the `.pt` extension, but these are actually just zip files.

```python
with open(section_dir / "pikachu.pt", "rb") as f:
    triangles = t.load(f)
```

## Mesh Rendering

For our purposes, a mesh is just a group of triangles, so to render it we'll intersect all rays and all triangles at once. We previously just returned a boolean for whether a given ray intersects the triangle, but now it's possible that more than one triangle intersects a given ray. 

For each ray (pixel) we will return a float representing the minimum distance to a triangle if applicable, otherwise the special value `float('inf')` representing infinity. We won't return which triangle was intersected for now.

Note - by distance to a triangle, we specifically mean **distance along the x-dimension**, not Euclidean distance.

### Exercise - implement `raytrace_mesh`

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšª

You should spend up to 20-25 minutes on this exercise.

This is the main function we've been building towards, and marks the end of the core exercises. If should involve a lot of repurposed code from the last excercise.
```

Implement `raytrace_mesh` and as before, reshape and visualize the output. Your Pikachu is centered on (0, 0, 0), so you'll want to slide the ray origin back to at least `x=-2` to see it properly.

Reminder - `t.linalg.solve` (and most batched operations) can accept multiple dimensions as being batch dims. Previously, you've just used `NR` (the number of rays) as the batch dimension, but you can also use `(NR, NT)` (the number of rays and triangles) as your batch dimensions, so you can solve for all rays and triangles at once.

```python
def raytrace_mesh(
    rays: Float[Tensor, "nrays rayPoints=2 dims=3"],
    triangles: Float[Tensor, "ntriangles trianglePoints=3 dims=3"]
) -> Float[Tensor, "nrays"]:
    '''
    For each ray, return the distance to the closest intersecting triangle, or infinity.
    '''
    pass

rays = make_rays_2d(num_pixels_y, num_pixels_z, y_limit, z_limit)
rays[:, 0] = t.tensor([-2, 0.0, 0.0])
dists = raytrace_mesh(rays, triangles)
intersects = t.isfinite(dists).view(num_pixels_y, num_pixels_z)
