# Bonus - convolutions from scratch

> ### Learning objectives
> 
> * Understand how array strides work, and why they're important for efficient linear operations
> * Learn how to use `as_strided` to perform simple linear operations like trace and matrix multiplication
> * Implement your own convolutions and maxpooling functions using stride-based methods

This section is designed to get you familiar with the implementational details of layers like `Linear` and `Conv2d`. You'll be using libraries like `einops`, and functions like `torch.as_strided` to get a very low-level picture of how these operations work, which will help build up your overall understanding.

Note that `torch.as_strided` isn't something which will come up explicitly in much of the rest of the course (unlike `einops`). The purpose of the stride exercises is more to give you an appreciation for what's going on under the hood, so that we can build layers of abstraction on top of that during the rest of this week (and by extension this course). I see this as analogous to how [many CS courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) start by teaching you about languages like C and concepts like pointers and memory management before moving on to higher-level langauges like Python which abstract away these details. The hope is that when you get to the later sections of the course, you'll have the tools to understand them better.
            

## Reading

* [Python NumPy, 6.1 - `as_strided()`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlkzN00P0Bc) explains what array strides are.
* [`as_strided` and `sum` are all you need](https://jott.live/markdown/as_strided) gives an overview of how to use `as_strided` to perform array operations. 
* [Advanced NumPy: Master stride tricks with 25 illustrated exercises](https://towardsdatascience.com/advanced-numpy-master-stride-tricks-with-25-illustrated-exercises-923a9393ab20) provides several clear and intuitive examples of `as_strided` being used to construct arrays.

## Basic stride exercises

Array strides, and the `as_strided` method, are important to understand well because lots of linear operations are actually implementing something like `as_strided` under the hood.

Run the following code, to define this tensor:

```python
test_input = t.tensor(
    [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 
    [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 
    [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 
    [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]], dtype=t.float
)
```

This tensor is stored in a contiguous block in computer memory.

We can call the `stride` method to get the strides of this particular array. Running `test_input.stride()`, we get `(5, 1)`. This means that we need to skip over one element in the storage of this tensor to get to the next element in the row, and 5 elements to get the next element in the column (because you have to jump over all 5 elements in the row). Another way of phrasing this: the `n`th element in the stride is the number of elements we need to skip over to move one index position in the `n`th dimension.


### Exercise - fill in the correct size and stride

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to ~30 minutes on these exercises collectively.

as_strided exercises can be notoriously confusing and fiddly, so you should be willing to look at the solution if you're stuck. They are not the most important part of the material today.
```

In the exercises below, we will work with the `test_input` tensor above. You should fill in the `size` and `stride` arguments so that calling `test_input.as_strided` with these arguments produces the desired output. When you run the cell, the `for` loop at the end will iterate through the test cases and print out whether the test passed or failed.

We've already filled in the first two as an example, along with illustrations explaining what's going on:

By the end of these examples, hopefully you'll have a clear idea of what's going on. If you're still confused by some of these, then the dropdown below the codeblock contains some annotations to explain the answers.

## Intermediate stride exercises

Now that you're comfortable with the basics, we'll dive a little deeper with `as_strided`. In the last few exercises of this section, you'll start to implement some more challenging stride functions: trace, matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication, just like we did for `einsum` in the previous section.


### Exercise - trace

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.

Use the hint if you're stuck.
```


```python
def as_strided_trace(mat: Float[Tensor, "i j"]) -> Float[Tensor, ""]:
    '''
    Returns the same as `torch.trace`, using only `as_strided` and `sum` methods.
    '''
    pass


tests.test_trace(as_strided_trace)
```

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

The trace is the sum of all the elements you get from starting at `[0, 0]` and then continually stepping down and right one element. Use strides to create a 1D array which contains these elements.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


```python
def as_strided_trace(mat: Float[Tensor, "i j"]) -> Float[Tensor, ""]:
    '''
    Returns the same as `torch.trace`, using only `as_strided` and `sum` methods.
    '''
    # SOLUTION

    stride = mat.stride()

    assert len(stride) == 2, f"matrix should have size 2"
    assert mat.size(0) == mat.size(1), "matrix should be square"

    diag = mat.as_strided((mat.size(0),), (stride[0] + stride[1],))

    return diag.sum()
```
</details>


### Exercise - matrix-vector multiplication

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise.

The hints should be especially useful here if you're stuck. There are two hints available to you.
```
                
You should implement this using only `as_strided` and `sum` methods, and elementwise multiplication `*` - in other words, no matrix multiplication functions!


```python
def as_strided_mv(mat: Float[Tensor, "i j"], vec: Float[Tensor, "j"]) -> Float[Tensor, "i"]:
    '''
    Returns the same as `torch.matmul`, using only `as_strided` and `sum` methods.
    '''
    pass


tests.test_mv(as_strided_mv)
tests.test_mv2(as_strided_mv)
```

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

You want your output array to be as follows:

$$
\text{output}[i] = \sum_j \text{mat}[i, j] \times \text{vector}[j]
$$

so first try to create an array with:

$$
\text{arr}[i, j] = \text{mat}[i, j] \times \text{vector}[j]
$$

then you can calculate `output` by summing over the second dimension of `arr`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

First try to use strides to create `vec_expanded` such that:

$$
\text{vec\_expanded}[i, j] = \text{vec}[j]
$$

We can then compute:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{arr}[i, j] &= \text{mat}[i, j] \times \text{vec\_expanded}[i, j] \\
\text{output}[i, j] &= \sum_j \text{arr}[i, j]
\end{align}
$$

with the first equation being a simple elementwise multiplication, and the second equation being a sum over the second dimension.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm passing the first test, but failing the second.</summary>

It's possible that the input matrices you recieve could themselves be the output of an `as_strided` operation, so that they're represented in memory in a non-contiguous way. Make sure that your `as_strided `operation is using the strides from the original input arrays, i.e. it's not just assuming the last element in the `stride()` tuple is 1.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


```python
def as_strided_mv(mat: Float[Tensor, "i j"], vec: Float[Tensor, "j"]) -> Float[Tensor, "i"]:
    '''
    Returns the same as `torch.matmul`, using only `as_strided` and `sum` methods.
    '''
    # SOLUTION

    sizeM = mat.shape
    sizeV = vec.shape

    strideV = vec.stride()

    assert len(sizeM) == 2, f"mat1 should have size 2"
    assert sizeM[1] == sizeV[0], f"mat{list(sizeM)}, vec{list(sizeV)} not compatible for multiplication"

    vec_expanded = vec.as_strided(mat.shape, (0, strideV[0]))

    product_expanded = mat * vec_expanded

    return product_expanded.sum(dim=1)
```
</details>


### Exercise - matrix-matrix multiplication

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise.

The hints should be especially useful here if you're stuck. There are two hints available to you.
```
                
Like the previous function, this should only involve `as_strided`, `sum`, and pointwise multiplication.


```python
def as_strided_mm(matA: Float[Tensor, "i j"], matB: Float[Tensor, "j k"]) -> Float[Tensor, "i k"]:
    '''
    Returns the same as `torch.matmul`, using only `as_strided` and `sum` methods.
    '''
    pass


tests.test_mm(as_strided_mm)
tests.test_mm2(as_strided_mm)
```

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

If you did the first one, this isn't too dissimilar. We have:

$$
\text{output}[i, k] = \sum_j \text{matA}[i, j] \times \text{matB}[j, k]
$$


so in this case, try to create an array with:

$$
\text{arr}[i, j, k] = \text{matA}[i, j] \times \text{matB}[j, k]
$$

then sum this array over `j` to get our output.

We need to create expanded versions of both `matA` and `matB` in order to take this product.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

We want to compute

$$
\text{matA\_expanded}[i, j, k] = \text{matA}[i, j]
$$

so our stride for `matA` should be `(matA.stride(0), matA.stride(1), 0)`.
        
A similar idea applies for `matB`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


```python
def as_strided_mm(matA: Float[Tensor, "i j"], matB: Float[Tensor, "j k"]) -> Float[Tensor, "i k"]:
    '''
    Returns the same as `torch.matmul`, using only `as_strided` and `sum` methods.
    '''
    # SOLUTION

    assert len(matA.shape) == 2, f"mat1 should have size 2"
    assert len(matB.shape) == 2, f"mat2 should have size 2"
    assert matA.shape[1] == matB.shape[0], f"mat1{list(matA.shape)}, mat2{list(matB.shape)} not compatible for multiplication"

    # Get the matrix strides, and matrix dims
    sA0, sA1 = matA.stride()
    dA0, dA1 = matA.shape
    sB0, sB1 = matB.stride()
    dB0, dB1 = matB.shape

    expanded_size = (dA0, dA1, dB1)

    matA_expanded_stride = (sA0, sA1, 0)
    matA_expanded = matA.as_strided(expanded_size, matA_expanded_stride)

    matB_expanded_stride = (0, sB0, sB1)
    matB_expanded = matB.as_strided(expanded_size, matB_expanded_stride)

    product_expanded = matA_expanded * matB_expanded

    return product_expanded.sum(dim=1)
```
</details>

## conv1d minimal

Here, we will implement the PyTorch `conv1d` function, which can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html). We will start with a simple implementation where `stride=1` and `padding=0`, with the other arguments set to their default values.

Firstly, some explanation of `conv1d` in PyTorch. The `1` in `1d` here refers to the number of dimensions along which we slide the weights (also called the kernel) when we convolve. Importantly, it does not refer to the number of dimensions of the tensors that are being used in our calculations. Typically the input and kernel are both 3D:

* `input.shape = (batch, in_channels, width)`
* `kernel.shape = (out_channels, in_channels, kernel_width)`

A typical convolution operation is illustrated in the sketch below. Some notes on this sketch:

* The `kernel_width` dimension of the kernel slides along the `width` dimension of the input. The `output_width` of the output is determined by the number of kernels that can be fit inside it; the formula can be seen in the right part of the sketch.
* For each possible position of the kernel inside the model (i.e. each freezeframe position in the sketch), the operation happening is as follows:
    * We take the product of the kernel values with the corresponding input values, and then take the sum
    * This gives us a single value for each output channel
    * These values are then passed into the output tensor
* The sketch assumes a batch size of 1. To generalise to a larger batch number, we can just imagine this operation being repeated identically on every input.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/ch0-conv1d-general.png" width=1050>

### A note on `out_channels`

The out_channels in a conv2d layer denotes the number of filters the layer uses. Each filter detects specific features in the input, producing an output with as many channels as filters.

This number isn't tied to the input image's channels but is a design choice in the neural network architecture. Commonly, powers of 2 are chosen for computational efficiency, and deeper layers might have more channels to capture complex features. Additionally, this parameter is sometimes chosen based on the heuristic of wanting to balance the parameter count / compute for each layer - which is why you often see `out_channels` growing as the size of each feature map gets smaller.

### Exercise - implement minimal 1D conv (part 1)

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise.

Use the diagram in the dropdown below, if you're stuck.
```

Below, you should implement `conv1d_minimal`. This is a function which works just like `conv1d`, but takes the default stride and padding values (these will be added back in later). You are allowed to use `as_strided` and `einsum`.

Because this is a difficult exercise, we've given you a "simplified" function to implement first. This gets rid of the batch dimension, and input & output channel dimensions, so you only have to think about `x` and `weights` being one-dimensional tensors:


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/ch0-conv1d-A.png" width=620>


```python
def conv1d_minimal_simple(x: Float[Tensor, "w"], weights: Float[Tensor, "kw"]) -> Float[Tensor, "ow"]:
    '''
    Like torch's conv1d using bias=False and all other keyword arguments left at their default values.

    Simplifications: batch = input channels = output channels = 1.

    x: shape (width,)
    weights: shape (kernel_width,)

    Returns: shape (output_width,)
    '''
    pass


tests.test_conv1d_minimal_simple(conv1d_minimal_simple)
```

<details>

This diagram illustrates the striding operation you'll need to perform on `x`. Once you do this, it's just a matter of using the right `einsum` operation to get the output.

Once you've implemented this function, you should now adapt it to make a "full version", which includes batch, in_channel and out_channel dimensions. If you're stuck, the dropdowns provide hints for how each of these new dimensions should be handled.


```python
def conv1d_minimal(x: Float[Tensor, "b ic w"], weights: Float[Tensor, "oc ic kw"]) -> Float[Tensor, "b oc ow"]:
    '''
    Like torch's conv1d using bias=False and all other keyword arguments left at their default values.

    x: shape (batch, in_channels, width)
    weights: shape (out_channels, in_channels, kernel_width)

    Returns: shape (batch, out_channels, output_width)
    '''
    pass

```

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm stuck on going from <code>conv1d_minimal_simple</code> to <code>conv1d_minimal</code>.</summary>

The principle is the same as before. In your function, you should:

* Create a strided version of `x` by adding a dimension of length `output_width` and with the same stride as the `width` stride of `x` (the purpose of which is to be able to do all the convolutions at once).
* Perform an einsum between this strided version of `x` and `weights`, summing over the appropriate dimensions.

The way each of the new dimensions `batch`, `out_channels` and `in_channels` are handled is as follows:

* `batch` - this is an extra dimension for `x`, it is *not* summed over when creating `output`.
* `out_channels` - this is an extra dimension for `weights`, it is *not* summed over when creating `output`.
* `in_channels` - this is an extra dimension for `weights` *and* for `x`, it *is* summed over when creating `output`.

## conv2d minimal

2D convolutions are conceptually similar to 1D. The only difference is in how you move the kernel across the tensor as you take your convolution. In this case, you will be moving the tensor across two dimensions:


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/ch0-conv2d-B.png" width=850>


For this reason, 1D convolutions tend to be used for signals (e.g. audio), 2D convolutions are used for images, and 3D convolutions are used for 3D scans (e.g. in medical applications). 


### Exercise - implement 2D minimal convolutions

```

You should implement `conv2d` in a similar way to `conv1d`. Again, this is expected to be difficult and there are several hints you can go through.


```python
def conv2d_minimal(x: Float[Tensor, "b ic h w"], weights: Float[Tensor, "oc ic kh kw"]) -> Float[Tensor, "b oc oh ow"]:

    x: shape (batch, in_channels, height, width)
    weights: shape (out_channels, in_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width)

    Returns: shape (batch, out_channels, output_height, output_width)
    '''
    pass


tests.test_conv2d_minimal(conv2d_minimal)
```

<details>
<summary>Hint & diagram</summary>

You should be doing the same thing that you did for the 1D version. The only difference is that you're introducing 2 new dimensions to your strided version of x, rather than 1 (their sizes should be `output_height` and `output_width`, and their strides should be the same as the original `height` and `width` strides of `x` respectively).

## Padding

For a full version of `conv`, and for `maxpool` (which will follow shortly), you'll need to implement `pad` helper functions. PyTorch has some very generic padding functions, but to keep things simple and build up gradually, we'll write 1D and 2D functions individually.

### Exercise - implement padding

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise, and the next.
```

Tips: 
* Use the `new_full` method of the input tensor. This is a clean way to ensure that the output tensor is on the same device as the input, and has the same dtype.
* You can use three dots to denote slicing over multiple dimensions. For instance, `x[..., 0]` will take the `0th` slice of `x` along its last dimension. This is equivalent to `x[:, 0]` for 2D, `x[:, :, 0]` for 3D, etc.


```python
def pad1d(x: t.Tensor, left: int, right: int, pad_value: float) -> t.Tensor:
    '''Return a new tensor with padding applied to the edges.

    x: shape (batch, in_channels, width), dtype float32

    Return: shape (batch, in_channels, left + right + width)
    '''
    pass


tests.test_pad1d(pad1d)
tests.test_pad1d_multi_channel(pad1d)
```

<details>
<summary>Help - I get <code>RuntimeError: The expanded size of the tensor (0) must match ...</code></summary>

This might be because you've indexed with `left : -right`. Think about what will happen here when `right` is zero.

```python
def pad1d(x: t.Tensor, left: int, right: int, pad_value: float) -> t.Tensor:
    '''Return a new tensor with padding applied to the edges.

    x: shape (batch, in_channels, width), dtype float32

    Return: shape (batch, in_channels, left + right + width)
    '''
    # SOLUTION

    B, C, W = x.shape
    output = x.new_full(size=(B, C, left + W + right), fill_value=pad_value)
    output[..., left : left + W] = x
    # Note - you can't use `left:-right`, because `right` might be zero.
    return output
```
</details>


Once you've passed the tests, you can implement the 2D version:


```python
def pad2d(x: t.Tensor, left: int, right: int, top: int, bottom: int, pad_value: float) -> t.Tensor:
    '''Return a new tensor with padding applied to the edges.

    x: shape (batch, in_channels, height, width), dtype float32

    Return: shape (batch, in_channels, top + height + bottom, left + width + right)
    '''
    pass

```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


```python
def pad2d(x: t.Tensor, left: int, right: int, top: int, bottom: int, pad_value: float) -> t.Tensor:
    '''Return a new tensor with padding applied to the edges.

    x: shape (batch, in_channels, height, width), dtype float32

    Return: shape (batch, in_channels, top + height + bottom, left + width + right)
    '''
    # SOLUTION

    B, C, H, W = x.shape
    output = x.new_full(size=(B, C, top + H + bottom, left + W + right), fill_value=pad_value)
    output[..., top : top + H, left : left + W] = x
    return output
```
</details>


## Full convolutions

Now, you'll extend `conv1d` to handle the `stride` and `padding` arguments.

`stride` is the number of input positions that the kernel slides at each step. `padding` is the number of zeros concatenated to each side of the input before the convolution.

Output shape should be `(batch, output_channels, output_length)`, where output_length can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{output\_length} = \left\lfloor\frac{\text{input\_length} + 2 \times \text{padding} - \text{kernel\_size}}{\text{stride}} \right\rfloor + 1
$$

Verify for yourself that the forumla above simplifies to the formula we used earlier when padding is 0 and stride is 1.

Docs for pytorch's `conv1d` can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html).

<summary>Hint - dealing with padding</summary>

As the first line of your function, replace `x` with the padded version of `x`. This way, you won't have to worry about accounting for padding in the rest of the function (e.g. in the formula for the output width).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint - dealing with strides</summary>

The following diagram shows how you should create the strided version of `x` differently, if you have a stride of 2 rather than the default stride of 1.

Remember, you'll need a new formula for `output_width` (see formula in the  [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html) for help with this, or see if you can derive it without help).

You should spend up to 20-25 minutes on this exercise.
```

A recurring pattern in these 2d functions is allowing the user to specify either an int or a pair of ints for an argument: examples are stride and padding. We've provided some type aliases and a helper function to simplify working with these.


```python
IntOrPair = Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]
Pair = Tuple[int, int]

def force_pair(v: IntOrPair) -> Pair:
    '''Convert v to a pair of int, if it isn't already.'''
    if isinstance(v, tuple):
        if len(v) != 2:
            raise ValueError(v)
        return (int(v[0]), int(v[1]))
    elif isinstance(v, int):
        return (v, v)
    raise ValueError(v)

# Examples of how this function can be used:

for v in [(1, 2), 2, (1, 2, 3)]:
    try:
        print(f"{v!r:9} -> {force_pair(v)!r}")
    except ValueError:
        print(f"{v!r:9} -> ValueError")

```

Finally, you can implement a full version of `conv2d`. If you've done the full version of `conv1d`, and you've done `conv2d_minimal`, then you should be able to pull code from here to help you.


```python

## Max pooling

We have just one function left now - **max pooling**. You can review the [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53) post from earlier to understand max pooling better.

A "max pooling" layer is similar to a convolution in that you have a window sliding over some number of dimensions. The main difference is that there's no kernel: instead of multiplying by the kernel and adding, you just take the maximum.

The way multiple channels work is also different. A convolution has some number of input and output channels, and each output channel is a function of all the input channels. There can be any number of output channels. In a pooling layer, the maximum operation is applied independently for each input channel, meaning the number of output channels is necessarily equal to the number of input channels.


### Exercise - implement 2D max pooling

Implement `maxpool2d` using `torch.as_strided` and `torch.amax` (= max over axes) together. Your version should behave the same as the PyTorch version, but only the indicated arguments need to be supported.


```python
def maxpool2d(
    x: Float[Tensor, "b ic h w"], 
    kernel_size: IntOrPair, 
    stride: Optional[IntOrPair] = None, 
    padding: IntOrPair = 0
) -> Float[Tensor, "b ic oh ow"]:
    '''
    Like PyTorch's maxpool2d.

    x: shape (batch, channels, height, width)
    stride: if None, should be equal to the kernel size

    Return: (batch, channels, output_height, output_width)
    '''
    pass


tests.test_maxpool2d(maxpool2d)
```

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Conceptually, this is similar to `conv2d`. 
    
In `conv2d`, you had to use `as_strided` to turn the 4D tensor `x` into a 6D tensor `x_strided` (adding dimensions over which you would take the convolution), then multiply this tensor by the kernel and sum over these two new dimensions.

`maxpool2d` is the same, except that you're simply taking max over those dimensions rather than a dot product with the kernel. So you should find yourself able to reuse a lot of code from your `conv2d` function.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm getting a small number of mismatched elements each time (e.g. between 0 and 5%).</summary>

This is likely because you used an incorrect `pad_value`. In the convolution function, we set `pad_value=0` so these values wouldn't have any effect in the linear transformation. What pad value would make our padded elements "invisible" when we take the maximum?
