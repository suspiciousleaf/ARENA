# ResNets

> ### Learning Objectives
>
> * Learn about skip connections, and how they help overcome the degradation problem
> * Learn about batch normalization, and why it is used in training
> * Assemble your own ResNet, and load in weights from PyTorch's ResNet implementation

## Reading

* [Batch Normalization in Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/batch-normalization-cnn)
* [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)

You should move on once you can answer the following questions:


<details>
<summary>"Batch Normalization allows us to be less careful about initialization." Explain this statement.</summary>

Weight initialisation methods like Xavier (which we encountered yesterday) are based on the idea of making sure the activations have approximately the same distribution across layers at initialisation. But batch normalisation ensures that this is the case as signals pass through the network.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Give three reasons why batch norm improves the performance of neural networks.</summary>

The reasons given in the first linked document above are:

* Normalising inputs speeds up computation
* Internal covariate shift is reduced, i.e. the mean and standard deviation is kept constant across the layers.
* Regularisation effect: noise internal to each minibatch is reduced
</details>

<details>
<summary>If you have an input tensor of size (batch, channels, width, height), and you apply a batchnorm layer, how many learned parameters will there be?</summary>

A mean and standard deviation is calculated for each channel (i.e. each calculation is done across the batch, width, and height dimensions). So the number of learned params will be `2 * channels`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>In the paper, the diagram shows additive skip connections (i.e. F(x) + x). One can also form concatenated skip connections, by "gluing together" F(x) and x into a single tensor. Give one advantage and one disadvantage of these, relative to additive connections.</summary>

One advantage of concatenation: the subsequent layers can re-use middle representations; maintaining more information which can lead to better performance. Also, this still works if the tensors aren't exactly the same shape. One disadvantage: less compact, so there may be more weights to learn in subsequent layers.

Crucially, both the addition and concatenation methods have the property of preserving information, to at least some degree of fidelity. For instance, you can [use calculus to show](https://theaisummer.com/skip-connections/#:~:text=residual%20skip%20connections.-,ResNet%3A%20skip%20connections%C2%A0via%C2%A0addition,-The%20core%20idea) that both methods will fix the vanishing gradients problem.
</details>


In this section, we'll do a more advanced version of the exercise in part 1. Rather than building a relatively simple network in which computation can be easily represented by a sequence of simple layers, we're going to build a more complex architecture which requires us to define nested blocks.

We'll start by defining a few more `nn.Module` objects, which we hadn't needed before.


## Sequential

Firstly, now that we're working with large and complex architectures, we should create a version of `nn.Sequential`. Recall that we briefly came across `nn.Sequential` at the end of the first day, when building our (extremely simple) neural network. As the name suggests, when an `nn.Sequential` is fed an input, it sequentially applies each of its submodules to the input, with the output from one module feeding into the next one.

The implementation is given to you below. A few notes:

* In initalization, we add to the `_modules` dictionary.
    * This is a special type of dict called an **ordered dictionary**, which preserves the order of elements that get added (although Python sort-of does this now by default).
    * When we call `self.parameters()`, this recursively goes through all modules in `self._modules`, and returns the params in those modules. This means we can nest sequentials within sequentials!
* The special `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` methods determine behaviour when we get and set modules within the sequential.
* The `repr` of the base class `nn.Module` already recursively prints out the submodules, so we don't need to write anything in `extra_repr`.
    * To see how this works in practice, try defining a `Sequential` which takes a sequence of modules that you've defined above, and see what it looks like when you print it.

Don't worry about deeply understanding this code. The main takeaway is that `nn.Sequential` is a useful list-like object to store modules, and apply them all sequentially.

<details>
<summary>Aside - initializing Sequential with an OrderedDict</summary>

The actual `nn.Sequential` module can be initialized with an ordered dictionary, rather than a list of modules. For instance, rather than doing this:

```python
seq = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 20),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(20, 30)
)
```

we can do this:

```python
seq = nn.Sequential(OrderedDict([
    ("linear1", nn.Linear(10, 20)),
    ("relu", nn.ReLU()),
    ("linear2", nn.Linear(20, 30))
]))
```

This is handy if we want to give each module an descriptive name.

The `Sequential` implementation below doesn't allow the input to be an OrderedDict. As a bonus exercise, can you rewrite the `__init__`, `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` methods to allow the input to be an OrderedDict?

</details>


```python
class Sequential(nn.Module):
    _modules: Dict[str, nn.Module]

    def __init__(self, *modules: nn.Module):
        super().__init__()
        for index, mod in enumerate(modules):
            self._modules[str(index)] = mod

    def __getitem__(self, index: int) -> nn.Module:
        index %= len(self._modules) # deal with negative indices
        return self._modules[str(index)]

    def __setitem__(self, index: int, module: nn.Module) -> None:
        index %= len(self._modules) # deal with negative indices
        self._modules[str(index)] = module

    def forward(self, x: t.Tensor) -> t.Tensor:
        '''Chain each module together, with the output from one feeding into the next one.'''
        for mod in self._modules.values():
            x = mod(x)
        return x

```

## BatchNorm2d

Now, we'll implement our `BatchNorm2d`, the layer described in the documents you hopefully read above.

Something which might have occurred to you as you read about batch norm - how does it work when in inference mode? It makes sense to normalize over a batch of multiple input data, but normalizing over a single datapoint doesn't make any sense! This is why we have to introduce a new PyTorch concept: **buffers**.

Unlike `nn.Parameter`, a buffer is not its own type and does not wrap a `Tensor`. A buffer is just a regular `Tensor` on which you've called [self.register_buffer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module.register_buffer) from inside a `nn.Module`. As an example, `self.register_buffer("variable_name", t.zeros(10))` will define an object `self.variable_name` and register it as a buffer.

What is a buffer, and why is it different to a standard attribute or to a `nn.Parameter` object? The differences are as follows:

* It is normally included in the output of `module.state_dict()`, meaning that `torch.save` and `torch.load` will serialize and deserialize it.
* It is moved between devices when you call `model.to(device)`.
* It is not included in `module.parameters`, so optimizers won't see or modify it. Instead, your module will modify it as appropriate within `forward`.

### Train and Eval Modes

This is your first implementation that needs to care about the value of `self.training`, which is set to True by default, and can be set to False by `self.eval()` or to True by `self.train()`.

In training mode, you should use the mean and variance of the batch you're on, but you should also update a stored `running_mean` and `running_var` on each call to `forward` using the "momentum" argument as described in the PyTorch docs. Your `running_mean` shuld be intialized as all zeros; your `running_var` should be initialized as all ones. Also, you should keep track of `num_batches_tracked`.

<details>
<summary>Aside on <code>num_batches_tracked</code> (optional, unimportant)</summary>

PyTorch uses this to calculate momentum for calculation of the moving averages in the event that the module is intialized with `momentum=None`, although you don't need to worry about this because you can assume that the momentum parameter will always be a float in our use cases; we're just keeping track of `num_batches_tracked` to be consistent with PyTorch's version of BatchNorm2d, and to make sure that our state dictionaries have the same items.

</details>

In eval mode, you should use the running mean and variance that you stored before (not the mean and variance from the current batch).


### Exercise - implement `BatchNorm2d`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 20-40 minutes on this exercise.

This is the most challenging module you'll have implemented so far. Getting all the dimensions and operations right can be tricky.
```

Implement `BatchNorm2d` according to the [PyTorch docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html). Call your learnable parameters `weight` and `bias` for consistency with PyTorch.

We're implementing it with `affine=True` and `track_running_stats=True`.

A few tips (some of them are repeated from above):

- Remember to differentiate between training mode, when `self.training=True` (you calculate mean & variance and update the running values) and eval mode, when `self.training=False` (you use the running values).
- After you''ve normalized `x`, don't forget to multiply by `weight` and add `bias` (you might need to reshape these tensors so that they broadcast correctly).

<details>
<summary>Help - I don't understand which dimensions I should be taking the mean over.</summary>

The input has shape `(batch, channels, height, width)` (where channels is synonymous with features). You want to calculate the mean and variance for each channel, meaning you should reduce over all dimensions except the first, e.g. `t.mean(x, dim=(0, 2, 3))`. You should then update the running mean and variance accordingly.

Tip: use the argument `keepdim=True` in your mean and variance calculations, to make sure that the mean & variance still broadcast with the original input when you calculate `(x - mean) / std`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Help - I don't understand what the formula for updating the running mean / variance should be.</summary>

You want `running_mean <- (1 - momentum) * running_mean + momentum * new_mean`. Again, make sure you get the dimensions right - all the tensors in this operation should be 1D, with shape `(num_features,)`. 

</details>

If you're struggling with this implementation, we do recommend reading the solution, because there are lots of non-obvious ways this implementation can go wrong.

```python
class BatchNorm2d(nn.Module):
    # The type hints below aren't functional, they're just for documentation
    running_mean: Float[Tensor, "num_features"]
    running_var: Float[Tensor, "num_features"]
    num_batches_tracked: Int[Tensor, ""] # This is how we denote a scalar tensor

        '''

        Name the learnable affine parameters `weight` and `bias` in that order.
        '''

        pass

    def forward(self, x: t.Tensor) -> t.Tensor:
        '''

        Compute the variance using `torch.var(x, unbiased=False)`
        Hint: you may also find it helpful to use the argument `keepdim`.

## AveragePool

Let's end our collection of `nn.Module`s with an easy one 🙂

The ResNet has a Linear layer with 1000 outputs at the end in order to produce classification logits for each of the 1000 classes. Any Linear needs to have a constant number of input features, but the ResNet is supposed to be compatible with arbitrary height and width, so we can't just do a pooling operation with a fixed kernel size and stride.

Luckily, the simplest possible solution works decently: take the mean over the spatial dimensions. Intuitively, each position has an equal "vote" for what objects it can "see".


### Exercise - implement `AveragePool`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪

You should spend up to 5-10 minutes on this exercise.
```

This should be a pretty straightforward implementation; it doesn't have any weights or parameters of any kind, so you only need to implement the `forward` method.


```python
class AveragePool(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x: t.Tensor) -> t.Tensor:
        '''
        x: shape (batch, channels, height, width)
        Return: shape (batch, channels)
        '''

        Return: shape (batch, channels)
        '''
        # SOLUTION
        return t.mean(x, dim=(2, 3))
```
</details>


## Building ResNet

Now we have all the building blocks we need to start assembling your own ResNet! The following diagram describes the architecture of ResNet34 - the other versions are broadly similar. Unless otherwise noted, convolutions have a kernel_size of 3x3, a stride of 1, and a padding of 1. None of the convolutions have biases. 


<details>
<summary>Question: there would be no advantage to enabling biases on the convolutional layers. Why?</summary>

Every convolution layer in this network is followed by a batch normalization layer. The first operation in the batch normalization layer is to subtract the mean of each output channel. But a convolutional bias just adds some scalar `b` to each output channel, increasing the mean by `b`. This means that for any `b` added, the batch normalization will subtract `b` to exactly negate the bias term.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question: why is it necessary for the output of the left and right computational tracks in ResidualBlock to be the same shape?</summary>

Because they're added together at the end of the tracks. If they weren't the same shape, then they couldn't be added together.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm confused about how the nested subgraphs work.</summary>

The right-most block in the diagram, `ResidualBlock`, is nested inside `BlockGroup` multiple times. When you see `ResidualBlock` in `BlockGroup`, you should visualise a copy of `ResidualBlock` sitting in that position. 
    
Similarly, `BlockGroup` is nested multiple times (four to be precise) in the full `ResNet34` architecture.

### Exercise - implement `ResidualBlock`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 15-30 minutes on this exercise.
```

Implement `ResidualBlock` by referring to the diagram.  A few more notes on the left and right branches of this diagram:

#### Left branch

This branch has 2 convolutional layers. One of them applies a stride (the `first_stride` argument below), and changes the number of features from `in_feats -> out_feats`. The second one is a shape-preserving convolution, i.e. it has stride 1 and changes the number of features from `out_feats -> out_feats`.

#### Right branch

You can think of this branch as essentially a skip connection. But remember, we need to add this branch's output onto the left branch's output at the end of the residual block. If the left branch doesn't change the shape of its inputs (i.e. no strides, and `in_feats == out_feats`) then we can just use the identity operator for this right branch (you can use `nn.Identity` for this). But if either we have strides or a different number of output features, then we can't use the identity for the right branch. Instead we use what is essentially the closest approximation to the identity - a 1x1 convolution with stride & channel arguments chosen to match the shape of the left branch (followed by a batchnorm to standardize the output). Note, you may assume that if `first_stride == 1` then we always have number of input features equal to number of output features (meaning you can use the identity operator for this branch if and only if `first_stride == 1`).

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm completely stuck on parts of the architecture.</summary>

In this case, you can use the following code to import your own `resnet34`, and inspect its architecture:

```python
resnet = models.resnet34()
print(torchinfo.summary(resnet, input_size=(1, 3, 64, 64)))
```

This will generate output telling you the names of each module, as well as the parameter counts.

Unfortunately, this function won't work on your own model if your model breaks when an image is passed through. Since a lot of the time mistakes in the architecture will mean your model doesn't work, you won't be able to use `torchinfo.summary` on your model. Instead, you should compare the models by printing them out.
</details>

class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_feats: int, out_feats: int, first_stride=1):
        '''

### Exercise - implement `BlockGroup`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

Implement `BlockGroup` according to the diagram. 

The number of channels changes from `in_feats` to `out_feats` in the first `ResidualBlock` (all subsequent blocks will have `out_feats` input channels and `out_feats` output channels). 

The `height` and `width` of the input will only be changed if `first_stride>1` (in which case it will be downsampled by exactly this amount). 

You can also read the docstring for a description of the input and output shapes.


```python

### Exercise - implement `ResNet34`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 25-30 minutes on this exercise.

You may have to return to this and previous exercises, if you find a bug later.
```

Last step! Assemble `ResNet34` using the diagram.


<details>
<summary>Help - I'm not sure how to construct each of the BlockGroups.</summary>

Each BlockGroup takes arguments `n_blocks`, `in_feats`, `out_feats` and `first_stride`. In the initialisation of `ResNet34` below, we're given a list of `n_blocks`, `out_feats` and `first_stride` for each of the BlockGroups. To find `in_feats` for each block, it suffices to note two things:
    
1. The first `in_feats` should be 64, because the input is coming from the convolutional layer with 64 output channels.
2. The `out_feats` of each layer should be equal to the `in_feats` of the subsequent layer (because the BlockGroups are stacked one after the other; with no operations in between to change the shape).

You can use these two facts to construct a list `in_features_per_group`, and then create your BlockGroups by zipping through all four lists.

<summary>Help - I'm not sure how to construct the 7x7 conv at the very start.</summary>

All the information about this convolution is given in the diagram, except for `in_channels`. Recall that the input to this layer is an RGB image. Can you deduce from this how many input channels your layer should have?

Now that you've built your `ResNet34`, we'll copy weights over from PyTorch's pretrained resnet to yours. This is a good way to verify that you've designed the architecture correctly.


```python
def copy_weights(my_resnet: ResNet34, pretrained_resnet: models.resnet.ResNet) -> ResNet34:
    '''Copy over the weights of `pretrained_resnet` to your resnet.'''
    
    # Get the state dictionaries for each model, check they have the same number of parameters & buffers
    mydict = my_resnet.state_dict()
    pretraineddict = pretrained_resnet.state_dict()
    assert len(mydict) == len(pretraineddict), "Mismatching state dictionaries."
    
    # Define a dictionary mapping the names of your parameters / buffers to their values in the pretrained model
    state_dict_to_load = {
        mykey: pretrainedvalue
        for (mykey, myvalue), (pretrainedkey, pretrainedvalue) in zip(mydict.items(), pretraineddict.items())
    }
    
    # Load in this dictionary to your model
    my_resnet.load_state_dict(state_dict_to_load)
    
    return my_resnet


pretrained_resnet = models.resnet34(weights=models.ResNet34_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)
my_resnet = copy_weights(my_resnet, pretrained_resnet)
```

This function uses the `state_dict()` method, which returns an  `OrderedDict` (documentation [here](https://realpython.com/python-ordereddict/)) object containing all the parameter/buffer names and their values. State dicts can be extracted from models, saved to your filesystem (this is a common way to store the results of training a model), and can also be loaded back into a model using the `load_state_dict` method. (Note that you can also load weights using a regular Python `dict`, but since Python 3.7, the builtin `dict` is guaranteed to maintain items in the order they're inserted.)

If the copying fails, this means that your model's layers don't match up with the layers in the PyTorch model implementation.

To debug here, we've given you a helpful function `print_param_count` (from `utils.py`), which takes two models and prints out a stylized dataframe comparing the parameter names and shapes of each model. It will tell you when your model matches up with the PyTorch implementation. It can be used as follows:

```python
print_param_count(my_resnet, pretrained_resnet)
```

You'll hopefully see something like the image below (the layer names not necessarily matching, but the parameter counts & shapes hopefully matching).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/Fundamentals/main/images/resnet-compared.png" width="900">

Tweaking your model until all the layers match up might be a difficult and frustrating exercise at times! However, it's a pretty good example of the kind of low-level model implementation and debugging that is important for your growth as ML engineers. We'll be doing a few more model-building exercises similar to these in later sections.


## Running Your Model

We've provided you with some images for your model to classify:


```python
IMAGE_FILENAMES = [
    "chimpanzee.jpg",
    "golden_retriever.jpg",
    "platypus.jpg",
    "frogs.jpg",
    "fireworks.jpg",
    "astronaut.jpg",
    "iguana.jpg",
    "volcano.jpg",
    "goofy.jpg",
    "dragonfly.jpg",
]

IMAGE_FOLDER = section_dir / "resnet_inputs"

images = [Image.open(IMAGE_FOLDER / filename) for filename in IMAGE_FILENAMES]
```

Our `images` are of type `PIL.Image.Image`, so we can just call them in a cell to display them.


```python
images[0]
```

We now need to define a `transform` object like we did for MNIST. We will use the same transforms to convert the PIL image to a tensor, and to normalize it. But we also want to resize the images to `height=224, width=224`, because not all of them start out with this size and we need them to be consistent before passing them through our model.

In the normalization step, we'll use a mean of `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`, and a standard deviation of `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]` (these are the mean and std dev of images from [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/)). Note that the means and std devs have three elements, because ImageNet contains RGB rather than monochrome images, and we're normalising over each of the three RGB channels separately.


```python
IMAGE_SIZE = 224
IMAGENET_MEAN = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
IMAGENET_STD = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

IMAGENET_TRANSFORM = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Resize((IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE)),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=IMAGENET_MEAN, std=IMAGENET_STD),
])

prepared_images = t.stack([IMAGENET_TRANSFORM(img) for img in images], dim=0)

assert prepared_images.shape == (len(images), 3, IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE)
```

### Exercise - verify your model's predictions

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to ~10 minutes on this exercise.
```

Lastly, you should run your model with these prepared images, and verify that your predictions are the same as the model's predictions.

You can do this by filling in the `predict` function below, then running the code. We've also provided you with a file `imagenet_labels.json` which you can use to get the actual classnames of imagenet data, and see what your model's predictions actually are.

```python
def predict(model, images: t.Tensor) -> t.Tensor:
    '''
    Returns the predicted class for each image (as a 1D array of ints).
    '''
    pass
    

with open(section_dir / "imagenet_labels.json") as f:
    imagenet_labels = list(json.load(f).values())

# Check your predictions match those of the pretrained model
my_predictions = predict(my_resnet, prepared_images)
pretrained_predictions = predict(pretrained_resnet, prepared_images)
assert all(my_predictions == pretrained_predictions)
print("All predictions match!")

# Print out your predictions, next to the corresponding images
for img, label in zip(images, my_predictions):
    print(f"Class {label}: {imagenet_labels[label]}")
    display(img)
    print()
```

```python
def predict(model, images: t.Tensor) -> t.Tensor:
    '''
    Returns the predicted class for each image (as a 1D array of ints).
    '''
    logits: t.Tensor = model(images)
    return logits.argmax(dim=1)
```

</details>

If you've done everything correctly, your version should give the same classifications, and the percentages should match at least to a couple decimal places.

If it does, congratulations, you've now run an entire ResNet, using barely any code from `torch.nn`! The only things we used were `nn.Module` and `nn.Parameter`.

If it doesn't, you get to practice model debugging! Remember to use the `utils.print_param_count` function that was provided.


<details>
<summary>Help! My model is predicting roughly the same percentage for every category!</summary>

This can indicate that your model weights are randomly initialized, meaning the weight loading process didn't actually take. Or, you reinitialized your model by accident after loading the weights.
</details>


### Aside - hooks

One problem you might have encountered is that your model outputs `NaN`s rather than actual numbers. When debugging this, it's useful to try and identify which module the error first appears in. This is a great use-case for **hooks**, which are something we'll be digging a lot more into during our mechanistic interpretability exercises later on.

A hook is basically a function which you can attach to a particular `nn.Module`, which gets executed during your model's forward or backward passes. Here, we'll only consider forward hooks. A hook function's type signature is:

```python
def hook(module: nn.Module, inputs: List[t.Tensor], output: t.Tensor) -> None:
    pass
```

The `inputs` argument is a list of the inputs to the module (often just one tensor), and the `output` argument is the output of the module. This hook gets registered to a module by calling `module.register_forward_hook(hook)`. During forward passes, the hook function will run.

Here is some code which will check for `NaN`s in the output of each module, and raise a `ValueError` if it finds any. We've also given you an example tiny network which produces a `NaN` in the output of the second layer, to demonstrate it on.


```python
class NanModule(nn.Module):
    '''
    Define a module that always returns NaNs (we will use hooks to identify this error).
    '''
    def forward(self, x):
        return t.full_like(x, float('nan'))


model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Identity(),
    NanModule(),
    nn.Identity()
)
    
    
def hook_check_for_nan_output(module: nn.Module, input: Tuple[t.Tensor], output: t.Tensor) -> None:
    '''
    Hook function which detects when the output of a layer is NaN.
    '''
    if t.isnan(output).any():
        raise ValueError(f"NaN output from {module}")


def add_hook(module: nn.Module) -> None:
    '''
    Register our hook function in a module.

    Use model.apply(add_hook) to recursively apply the hook to model and all submodules.
    '''
    module.register_forward_hook(hook_check_for_nan_output)


def remove_hooks(module: nn.Module) -> None:
    '''
    Remove all hooks from module.

    Use module.apply(remove_hooks) to do this recursively.
    '''
    module._backward_hooks.clear()
    module._forward_hooks.clear()
    module._forward_pre_hooks.clear()


model = model.apply(add_hook)
input = t.randn(3)

try:
    output = model(input)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

model = model.apply(remove_hooks)
```

When you run this code, you should find it raising an error at the `NanModule`.

> Important - when you're working with PyTorch hooks, make sure you remember to remove them at the end of each exercise! This is a classic source of bugs, and one of the things that make PyTorch hooks so janky. When we study TransformerLens in the next chapter, we'll use a version of hooks that is essentially the same under the hood, but comes with quite a few quality of life improvements!
