# Bonus - Feature Extraction
                
> ### Learning Objectives
> 
> * Understand the difference between feature extraction and finetuning
> * Perform feature extraction on a pre-trained ResNet

Now that you've seen how to build a modular training loop, and you've seen how ResNet works and is built, we're going to put these two things together to finetune a ResNet model on a new dataset.

**Finetuning** can mean slightly different things in different contexts, but broadly speaking it means using the weights of an already trained network as the starting values for training a new network. Because training networks from scratch is very computationally expensive, this is a common practice in ML.

The specific type of finetuning we'll be doing here is called **feature extraction**. This is when we freeze most layers of a model except the last few, and perform gradient descent on those. We call this feature extraction because the earlier layers of the model have already learned to identify important features of the data (and these features are also relevant for the new task), so all that we have to do is train a few final layers in the model to extract these features. 

*Terminology note - sometimes feature extraction and finetuning are defined differently, with finetuning referring to the training of all the weights in a pretrained model (usually with a small or decaying learning rate), and feature extraction referring to the freezing of some layers and training of others. To avoid confusion here, we'll use the term "feature extraction" rather than "finetuning".*

How do we prepare a model for feature extraction? By **freezing layers** of our model.

We'll discuss freezing layers & the backpropagation algorithm in much more detail tomorrow, but for now it's fine to just understand what's going on at a basic level. When we call `loss.backward()` in our training loop (or when this is implicitly called by our PyTorch Lightning trainer), this propagates gradients from our `loss` scalar back to all parameters in our model. If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.

See the code below as an example of how gradient propagation stops at tensors with `requires_grad = False`.


```python
layer0, layer1 = nn.Linear(3, 4), nn.Linear(4, 5)

layer0.requires_grad_(False) # generic code to set `param.requires_grad = False` recursively for a module (or entire model)

x = t.randn(3)
out = layer1(layer0(x)).sum()
out.backward()

assert layer0.weight.grad is None
assert layer1.weight.grad is not None
```

### Exercise - prepare ResNet for feature extraction

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

First, you should complete the function below to do the following:

* Instantiate a `ResNet34` model using your class, and copy in weights from a pretrained model (you can use code from earlier here)
* Disable gradients for all layers
* Replace the final linear layer with a new linear layer, which has the same number of `in_features`, but a different number of `out_features` (given by the `n_classes` argument).


```python
def get_resnet_for_feature_extraction(n_classes: int) -> ResNet34:
    '''
    Creates a ResNet34 instance, replaces its final linear layer with a classifier
    for `n_classes` classes, and freezes all weights except the ones in this layer.

    Returns the ResNet model.
    '''
    pass


tests.test_get_resnet_for_feature_extraction(get_resnet_for_feature_extraction)
```

```python
def get_resnet_for_feature_extraction(n_classes: int) -> ResNet34:
    '''
    Creates a ResNet34 instance, replaces its final linear layer with a classifier
    for `n_classes` classes, and freezes all weights except the ones in this layer.

    Returns the ResNet model.
    '''
    # SOLUTION
    # Create a ResNet34 with the default number of classes
    my_resnet = ResNet34()

    # Load the pretrained weights
    pretrained_resnet = models.resnet34(weights=models.ResNet34_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)

    # Copy the weights over
    my_resnet = copy_weights(my_resnet, pretrained_resnet)

    # Freeze gradients for all layers (note that when we redefine the last layer, it will be unfrozen)
    my_resnet.requires_grad_(False)    

    # Redefine last layer
    my_resnet.out_layers[-1] = Linear(
        my_resnet.out_features_per_group[-1],
        n_classes
    )

    return my_resnet
```
</details>


We'll now give you some boilerplate code to load in and transform your data (this code should be quite familiar to you from the code in earlier sections).


```python
def get_cifar(subset: int):
    cifar_trainset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=IMAGENET_TRANSFORM)
    cifar_testset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=IMAGENET_TRANSFORM)

    if subset > 1:
        cifar_trainset = Subset(cifar_trainset, indices=range(0, len(cifar_trainset), subset))
        cifar_testset = Subset(cifar_testset, indices=range(0, len(cifar_testset), subset))
        
    return cifar_trainset, cifar_testset


@dataclass
class ResNetTrainingArgs():
    batch_size: int = 64
    epochs: int = 3
    learning_rate: float = 1e-3
    n_classes: int = 10
    subset: int = 10
```

The dataclass we've defined containing training arguments is basically the same as the one we had for the convnet, the main difference is that we're now using the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). This is the dataset we'll be training our model on. It consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. See the link for more information.


### Exercise - write training loop for feature extraction

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-25 minutes on this exercise.
```

We now come to the final task - write a training loop for your ResNet model. 

A few things to remember:

* You can optionally pass only a subset of your model's parameters to the optimizer when defining it, e.g. `Adam(model.out_layers[-1].parameters(), ...)`. But you don't have to do this, because the gradients for all other parameters have been frozen.
* Make sure you call `model.train()` before your training loop, and `model.eval()` before your validation loop. This changes the behaviour of your BatchNorm layers (recall from the previous section that BatchNorm behaves differently in eval mode, using lagged mean and variance estimators rather than computing mean and variance across the input data).
* Because the dataset is large, you might want nested progress bars: one for the epochs, and one for each epoch.

```python
# YOUR CODE HERE - write your `ResNetTrainer` class

args = ResNetTrainingArgs()
trainer = ResNetTrainer(args)
trainer.train()
plot_train_loss_and_test_accuracy_from_trainer(trainer, title="Feature extraction with ResNet34")
```

<details>
<summary>Spoilers - what kind of results should you get?</summary>

If you train the whole model rather than just the final layer, you should find accuracy increases very slowly, not getting very far above random chance. This reflects the fact that the model is trying to learn a new task (classifying images into 10 classes) from scratch, rather than just learning to extract features from images, and this takes a long time!

If you train just the final layer, your accuracy should reach around 70-80% by the first epoch. This is because the model is already very good at extracting features from images, and it just needs to learn how to turn these features into predictions for this new set of classes.
