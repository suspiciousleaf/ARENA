# Autoencoders & VAEs

> ### Learning Objectives
>
> * Understand the basic architecture of autoencoders and VAEs
> * Learn about the reparameterization trick for VAEs
> * Implement your own autoencoder
> * Implement your own VAE, and use it to generate realistic MNIST images
> * (optional) Dive deeper into the mathematical underpinnings of VAEs, and learn about the ELBO loss function

## Reading

* [Understanding VAEs (Towards Data Science)](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73)
    * A clear and accessible explanation of autoencoders and VAEs.
    * You can stop at "Mathematical details of VAEs"; we'll (optionally) cover this in more detail later.
* [Six (and a half) intuitions for KL divergence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/no5jDTut5Byjqb4j5/six-and-a-half-intuitions-for-kl-divergence)
    * Optional reading.
    * KL divergence is an important concept in VAEs (and will continue to be a useful concept for the rest of this course).
* [From Autoencoder to Beta-VAE](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/)
    * Optional reading.
    * This is a more in-depth look at VAEs, the maths behind them, and different architecture variants.

## Autoencoders

We'll start by looking at **Autoencoders**, which are much conceptually simpler than VAEs. These are simply systems which learn a compressed representation of the input, and then reconstruct it. There are two parts to this:

* The **encoder** learns to compress the output into a latent space which is lower-dimensional than the original image.
* The **decoder** learns to uncompress the encoder's output back into a faithful representation of the original image.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/ae-diagram-light.png" width="700">
                
Our loss function is simply some metric of the distance between the input and the reconstructed input, e.g. the $l_2$ loss.

You'll start by writing your own autoencoder. This should be a lot like the GANs exercise in the previous section. We've given some guidance on architecture below.

*Note - for the rest of this section (not including the bonus), we'll assume we're working with the MNIST dataset rather than Celeb-A.*

### Autoencoder architecture

Your encoder should consist of two convolutional blocks (i.e. convolution plus ReLU), followed by two fully connected linear layers with a ReLU in between them. Both convolutions will have kernel size 4, stride 2, padding 1 (recall this halves the size of the image). We'll have 16 and 32 output channels respectively.

The decoder will be the exact mirror image of the encoder (with convolutions replaced by transposed convolutions).

Relative to your GAN implementation, the architecture will be relatively fixed: the two arguments `latent_dim_size` and `hidden_dim_size` will determine the size of the latent space and the sizes of the linear layers respectively.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/ae-help-light-10.png" width="1100">

A few extra notes:

* You'll need to reshape between the convolutional blocks and linear layers.
* Note that we don't include a ReLU in the very last layer of the decoder or generator, we only include them ***between successive convolutions or linear layers*** - can you see why it wouldn't make sense to put ReLUs at the end?
* The convolutions don't have biases, although we have included biases in the linear layers (this will be important if you want your parameter count to match the solution, but not really that important for good performance).

```python

        super().__init__()
        self.latent_dim_size = latent_dim_size
        self.hidden_dim_size = hidden_dim_size
        self.encoder = Sequential(
            Conv2d(1, 16, 4, stride=2, padding=1),
            ReLU(),
            Conv2d(16, 32, 4, stride=2, padding=1),
            ReLU(),
            Rearrange("b c h w -> b (c h w)"),
            Linear(7 * 7 * 32, hidden_dim_size),

            Linear(hidden_dim_size, latent_dim_size)
        )
        self.decoder = Sequential(
            Linear(latent_dim_size, hidden_dim_size),
            ReLU(),
            Linear(hidden_dim_size, 7 * 7 * 32),
            ReLU(),
            Rearrange("b (c h w) -> b c w h", c=32, h=7, w=7),
            ConvTranspose2d(32, 16, 4, stride=2, padding=1),
            ReLU(),
            ConvTranspose2d(16, 1, 4, stride=2, padding=1),
        )

    def forward(self, x: t.Tensor) -> t.Tensor:
        z = self.encoder(x)
        x_prime = self.decoder(z)
        return x_prime
```
</details>

You can test your answer the same way as with the GAN - by comparing the architecture to the solution directly.

```python
soln_Autoencoder = solutions.Autoencoder(latent_dim_size=5, hidden_dim_size=128)
my_Autoencoder = Autoencoder(latent_dim_size=5, hidden_dim_size=128)

utils.print_param_count(my_Autoencoder, soln_Autoencoder)
```

Once you've done this, you should write a training loop which works with [MSE loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MSELoss.html) between the original and reconstructed data. The standard Adam optimiser with default parameters should suffice.

Much like for the generator, you will find it helpful to display output while your model is training. There are actually two ways you can do this:

1. Take an MNIST image and feed it into your autoencoder - your result should look similar to the input.
2. Take a random vector in the latent space, and run just the decoder on it in order to produce an output (this is what we did for our GAN).

The problem with (2) (which we'll discuss more when we get to VAEs) is that your latent space might not actually be meaningful. In other words, it's unclear exactly how to sample from it to get output which will look like an MNIST image. For that reason, you're recommended to do (1) instead. You should also do standard things like printing out the loss as your model trains (or logging the result to Weights and Biases).

The code below creates a tensor `HOLDOUT_DATA` of shape `(10, 1, 28, 28)`, consisting of one of each kind of digit. You'll use this in the `evaluate` function below.

```python
testset = get_dataset("MNIST", train=False)
HOLDOUT_DATA = dict()
for data, target in DataLoader(testset, batch_size=1):
    if target.item() not in HOLDOUT_DATA:
        HOLDOUT_DATA[target.item()] = data.squeeze()
        if len(HOLDOUT_DATA) == 10: break
HOLDOUT_DATA = t.stack([HOLDOUT_DATA[i] for i in range(10)]).to(dtype=t.float, device=device).unsqueeze(1)

display_data(HOLDOUT_DATA, nrows=2, title="MNIST holdout data")
```

### Exercise - write autoencoder training loop

```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-25 minutes on this exercise. It should recycle a lot of previous code.
```

Again, we've given you a template for the trainer class, and we've filled in everything except the training step and the evaluation method. Note - for evaluation this time, you should use the global `HOLDOUT_DATA` tensor we defined above. Remember that you're mapping MNIST images through your encoder and decoder, rather than generating images from random noise like you did for the GAN.

After ten epochs, you should be able to get output of the following quailty:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/autoencoder_2.png" width="700">

This is a pretty faithful representation. Note how it's mixing up features for some of the numbers - for instance, the 5 seems to have been partly reproduced as a 9. But overall, it seems pretty accurate!

## Generating images from an autoencoder

We'll now return to the issue we mentioned briefly earlier - how to generate output? This was easy for our GAN; the only way we ever produced output was by putting random noise into the generator. But how should we interpret the latent space between our encoder and decoder?

We can try and plot the outputs produced by the decoder over a range. The code below does this for the model in the solutions (you might have to make some small adjustments depending on exactly how you've implemented your autoencoder).

```python
@t.inference_mode()
def visualise_output(
    model: Autoencoder,
    n_points: int = 11,
    interpolation_range: Tuple[float, float] = (-3, 3),
) -> None:
    '''
    Visualizes the output of the decoder, along the first two latent dims.
    '''
    # Constructing latent dim data by making two of the dimensions vary indep in the interpolation range
    grid_latent = t.zeros(n_points**2, model.latent_dim_size).to(device)
    x = t.linspace(*interpolation_range, n_points).to(device)
    grid_latent[:, 0] = einops.repeat(x, "dim1 -> (dim1 dim2)", dim2=n_points)
    grid_latent[:, 1] = einops.repeat(x, "dim2 -> (dim1 dim2)", dim1=n_points)

    # Pass through decoder
    output = model.decoder(grid_latent).cpu().numpy()

    # Normalize & truncate, then unflatten back into a grid shape
    output_truncated = np.clip((output * 0.3081) + 0.1307, 0, 1)
    output_single_image = einops.rearrange(
        output_truncated,
        "(dim1 dim2) 1 height width -> (dim1 height) (dim2 width)",
        dim1=n_points
    )

    # Display the results
    px.imshow(
        output_single_image,
        color_continuous_scale="greys_r",
        title="Decoder output from varying first principal components of latent space"
    ).update_layout(
        xaxis=dict(title_text="dim1", tickmode="array", tickvals=list(range(14, 14+28*n_points, 28)), ticktext=[f"{i:.2f}" for i in x]),
        yaxis=dict(title_text="dim2", tickmode="array", tickvals=list(range(14, 14+28*n_points, 28)), ticktext=[f"{i:.2f}" for i in x])
    ).show()


visualise_output(trainer.model)
```

(Note, we normalize with `(0.3081, 0.1307)` because this is the mean and standard deviation of the MNIST dataset - see discussion [here](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/normalization-in-the-mnist-example/457).)

This generates images from a vector in the latent space which is zero in all directions, except for the first two [principal directions](https://www.sartorius.com/en/knowledge/science-snippets/what-is-principal-component-analysis-pca-and-how-it-is-used-507186#:~:text=Principal%20component%20analysis%2C%20or%20PCA,more%20easily%20visualized%20and%20analyzed.). The output should look something like:

This is ... pretty underwhelming actually. Although some of these shapes seem legible at the perimeters, a lot of the space doesn't look like any recognisable number (e.g. the middle values are pretty close to black).

Why is this? Well unfortunately, the model has no reason to treat the latent space in any meaningful way. It might be the case that almost all the images are embedded into a particular subspace of the latent space, and so the encoder only gets trained on inputs in this subspace. To further illustrate this, the code below feeds MNIST data into your encoder, and plots the resulting latent vectors (projected along the first two latent dimensions).

```python
@t.inference_mode()
def visualise_input(
    model: Autoencoder,
    dataset: Dataset,
) -> None:
    '''
    Visualises (in the form of a scatter plot) the input data in the latent space, along the first two dims.
    '''
    # First get the model images' latent vectors, along first 2 dims
    imgs = t.stack([batch for batch, label in dataset]).to(device)
    latent_vectors = model.encoder(imgs)
    if latent_vectors.ndim == 3: latent_vectors = latent_vectors[0] # useful for VAEs later
    latent_vectors = latent_vectors[:, :2].cpu().numpy()
    labels = [str(label) for img, label in dataset]

    # Make a dataframe for scatter (px.scatter is more convenient to use when supplied with a dataframe)
    df = pd.DataFrame({"dim1": latent_vectors[:, 0], "dim2": latent_vectors[:, 1], "label": labels})
    df = df.sort_values(by="label")
    fig = px.scatter(df, x="dim1", y="dim2", color="label")
    fig.update_layout(height=700, width=700, title="Scatter plot of latent space dims", legend_title="Digit")
    data_range = df["dim1"].max() - df["dim1"].min()

    # Add images to the scatter plot (optional)
    output_on_data_to_plot = model.encoder(HOLDOUT_DATA.to(device))[:, :2].cpu()
    if output_on_data_to_plot.ndim == 3: output_on_data_to_plot = output_on_data_to_plot[0] # useful for VAEs; see later
    data_translated = (HOLDOUT_DATA.cpu().numpy() * 0.3081) + 0.1307
    data_translated = (255 * data_translated).astype(np.uint8).squeeze()
    for i in range(10):
        x, y = output_on_data_to_plot[i]
        fig.add_layout_image(
            source=Image.fromarray(data_translated[i]).convert("L"),
            xref="x", yref="y",

small_dataset = Subset(get_dataset("MNIST"), indices=range(0, 5000))

You should see something like the plot below. Note that there are some very high-density spots, and other much lower-density spots. So it stands to reason that we shouldn't expect the decoder to be able to produce good output for all points in the latent space (especially when we're using a 5-dimensional latent space rather than just 2-dimensional as visualised below - we can imagine that 5D latent space would have significantly more "dead space").

To emphasise, we're not looking for a crisp separation of digits here. We're only plotting 2 of 5 dimensions, it would be a coincidence if they were cleanly separated. We're looking for efficient use of the space, because this is likely to lead to an effective generator when taken out of the context of the discriminator. We don't really see that here.

## Variational Autoencoders

Variational autoencoders try and solve the problem posed by autoencoders: how to actually make the latent space meaningful, such that you can generate output by feeding a $N(0, 1)$ random vector into your model's decoder?

The key perspective shift is this: **rather than mapping the input into a fixed vector, we map it into a distribution**. The way we learn a distribution is very similar to the way we learn our fixed inputs for the autoencoder, i.e. we have a bunch of linear or convolutional layers, our input is the original image, and our output is the tuple of parameters $(\mu(\boldsymbol{x}), \Sigma(\boldsymbol{x}))$ (as a trivial example, our VAE learning a distribution $\mu(\boldsymbol{x})=z(\boldsymbol{x})$, $\Sigma(\boldsymbol{x})=0$ is equivalent to our autoencoder learning the function $z(\boldsymbol{x})$ as its encoder).

From this [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73) article:

> Due to overfitting, the latent space of an autoencoder can be extremely irregular (close points in latent space can give very *different* decoded data, some point of the latent space can give *meaningless* content once decoded) and, so, we canâ€™t really define a *generative* process that simply consists to sample a point from the *latent space* and make it go through the decoder to get new data. *Variational autoencoders* (VAEs) are autoencoders that tackle the problem of the latent space irregularity by making the encoder return a *distribution over the latent space* instead of a single point and by adding in the loss function a *regularisation* term over that returned distribution in order to ensure a better *organisation* of the latent space.

Or, in fewer words:

> **A variational autoencoder can be defined as being an autoencoder whose training is regularised to avoid overfitting and ensure that the latent space has good properties that enable generative process.**

At first, this idea of mapping to a distribution sounds like a crazy hack - why on earth does it work? This diagram should help convey some of the intuitions:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/vae-scatter-light.png" width="800">

With our encoder, there was nothing incentivising us to make full and meaningful use of the latent space. It's hypothetically possible that our network was mapping all the inputs to some very small subspace and reconstructing them with perfect fidelity. This wouldn't have required numbers with different features to be far apart from each other in the latent space, because even if they are close together no information is lost. See the first image above.

But with our variational autoencoder, each MNIST image produces a **sample** from the latent space, with a certain mean and variance. This means that, when two numbers look very different, their latent vectors are forced apart - if the means were close together then the decoder wouldn't be able to reconstruct them.

Another nice property of using random latent vectors is that the entire latent space will be meaningful. For instance, with autoencoders there is no reason why we should expect the linear interpolation between two points in the latent space to have meaningful decodings. The decoder output *will* change continuously as we continuously vary the latent vector, but that's about all we can say about it. However, if we use a variational autoencoder, we don't have this problem. The output of a linear interpolation between the cluster of $2$s and cluster of $7$s will be ***"a symbol which pattern-matches to the family of MNIST digits, but has equal probability to be interpreted as a $2$ or a $7$"***, and this is indeed what we find.

### Reparameterisation trick

One question that might have occurred to you - how can we perform backward passes through our network? We know how to differentiate with respect to the inputs to a function, but how can we differentiate wrt the parameters of a probability distribution from which we sample our vector? The solution is to convert our random sampling into a function, by introducing an extra parameter $\epsilon$. We sample $\epsilon$ from the standard normal distribution, and then express $\boldsymbol{z}$ as a deterministic function of $\mu$, $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$:

$$
z = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon
$$

where $\odot$ is a notation meaning pointwise product, i.e. $z_i = \mu_i + \sigma_i \epsilon_i$. We effectively "offload the randomness to $\epsilon$."

Intuitively, we can think of this as follows: when there is randomness in the process that generates the output, there is also randomness in the derivative of the output wrt the input, so **we can get a value for the derivative by sampling from this random distribution**. If we average over enough samples, this will give us a valid gradient for training.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/vae-reparam-light.png" width="800">

Note that if we have $\sigma_\theta(\boldsymbol{x})=0$ for all $\boldsymbol{x}$, the VAE reduces to an autoencoder (since the latent vector $z = \mu_\theta(\boldsymbol{x})$ is once again a deterministic function of $\boldsymbol{x}$). This is why it's important to add a KL-divergence term to the loss function, to make sure this doesn't happen. It's also why, if you print out the average value of $\sigma(\boldsymbol{x})$ while training, you'll probably see it stay below 1 (it's being pulled towards 1 by the KL-divergence loss, **and** pulled towards 0 by the reconstruction loss).

---

Before you move on to implementation details, there are a few questions below designed to test your understanding. They are based on material from this section, as well as the [KL divergence LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/no5jDTut5Byjqb4j5/six-and-a-half-intuitions-for-kl-divergence). You might also find [this post](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#vae-variational-autoencoder) on VAEs from the readings helpful.

<details>
<summary>State in your own words why we need the reparameterization trick in order to train our network.</summary>

One sentence summary:

We can't backpropagate through random processes like $z_i \sim N(\mu_i(\boldsymbol{x}), \sigma_i(\boldsymbol{x})^2)$, but if we instead write $\boldsymbol{z}$ as a deterministic function of $\mu_i(\boldsymbol{x})$ and $\sigma_i(\boldsymbol{x})$ (plus some auxiliary random variable $\epsilon$) then we can differentiate our loss function wrt the inputs, and train our network.

Longer summary:

Our encoder works by generating parameters and then using those parameters to sample latent vectors $\boldsymbol{z}$ (i.e. a **stochastic process**). Our decoder is deterministic; it just maps our latent vectors $\boldsymbol{z}$ to fixed outputs $x'$. The stochastic part is the problem; we can't backpropagate gradients through random functions. However, instead of just writing $\boldsymbol{z} \sim N(\mu_\theta(\boldsymbol{x}), \sigma_\theta(\boldsymbol{x})^2I)$, we can write $\boldsymbol{z}$ as a deterministic function of its inputs: $z = g(\theta, x, \epsilon)$, where $\theta$ are the parameters of the distribution, $\boldsymbol{x}$ is the input, and $\epsilon$ is a randomly sampled value. We can then backpropagate through the network.

<summary>Summarize in one sentence what concept we're capturing when we measure the KL divergence D(P||Q) between two distributions.</summary>

Any of the following would work - $D(P||Q)$ is...

* How much information is lost if the distribution $Q$ is used to represent $P$.
* The quality of $Q$ as a probabilistic model for $P$ (where lower means $Q$ is a better model).
* How close $P$ and $Q$ are, with $P$ as the actual ground truth.
* How much evidence you should expect to get for hypothesis $P$ over $Q$, when $P$ is the actual ground truth.

## Building a VAE

For your final exercise of today, you'll build a VAE and run it to produce the same kind of output you did in the previous section. Luckily, this won't require much tweaking from your encoder architecture. The decoder can stay unchanged; there are just two big changes you'll need to make:

### Probabilistic encoder

Rather than your encode outputting a latent vector $\boldsymbol{z}$, it should output a mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$; both vectors of dimension `latent_dim_size`. We then sample our latent vector $\boldsymbol{z}$ using $z_i = \mu_i + \sigma_i \cdot \epsilon_i$. Note that this is equivalent to $z = \mu + \Sigma \epsilon$ as shown in the diagram above, but where we assume $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix (i.e. the auxiliary random variables $\epsilon$ which we're sampling are independent). This is the most common approach taken in situations like these.

Note - we actually calculate `mu` and `logsigma` rather than `mu` and `sigma` - we get `sigma = logsigma.exp()` from this. This is a more numerically stable method.

How exactly should this work in your model's architecture? You can replace the final linear layer (which previously just gave you the latent vector) with two linear layers returning `mu` and `logsigma`, then you calculate `z` from these (and from a randomly sampled `epsilon`). If you want, you can combine the two linear layers into one linear layer with `out_channels=2*latent_dim_size`, then rearrange to split this up into `mu` and `logsigma` (this is what we do in the solution, and in the diagram below).

You should also return the parameters `mu` and `logsigma` in your VAE's forward function, as well as the final output - the reasons for this will become clear below.

You should spend up to 10-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

Build your VAE. It should be identical to the autoencoder you built above, except for the changes made at the end of the encoder (outputting mean and std rather than a single latent vector; this latent vector needs to get generated via the reparameterisation trick).

As a suggested implementation, we've defined a `sample_latent_vector` method. This takes an input `x`, passes it through the encoder, and returns the latent vector `z` as well as the mean and log standard deviation of the distribution. This is useful because we'll need to use this method in our loss function, but also because it's useful to be able to generate samples from our model for evaluation purposes.

```python
class VAE(nn.Module):
    encoder: nn.Module
    decoder: nn.Module

    def __init__(self, latent_dim_size: int, hidden_dim_size: int):
        super().__init__()
        pass

    def sample_latent_vector(self, x: t.Tensor) -> Tuple[t.Tensor, t.Tensor, t.Tensor]:
        '''
        Passes `x` through the encoder. Returns the mean and log std dev of the latent vector,
        as well as the latent vector itself. This function can be used in `forward`, but also
        used on its own to generate samples for evaluation.
        '''
        # Your code here
        return (z, mu, logsigma)

    def forward(self, x: t.Tensor) -> Tuple[t.Tensor, t.Tensor, t.Tensor]:
        '''
        Passes `x` through the encoder and decoder. Returns the reconstructed input, as well
        as mu and logsigma.
        '''
        # Your code here
        return (x_prime, mu, logsigma)
```

Code to test your model performs a forward pass:

```python
model = VAE(latent_dim_size=5, hidden_dim_size=100)

trainset_mnist = get_dataset("MNIST")
x = next(iter(DataLoader(trainset_mnist, batch_size=8)))[0]
print(torchinfo.summary(model, input_data=x))
```

You can also do the previous thing (compare your architecture to the solution), but this might be less informative if your model doesn't implement the 2-variables approach in the same way as the solution does.

## Training VAEs

### New loss function

We're no longer calculating loss simply as the reconstruction error between the original input $\boldsymbol{x}$ and our decoder's output $\boldsymbol{x}'$. Instead, we have a new loss function. For a fixed input $\boldsymbol{x}$, our loss is:

$$
L_{\mathrm{VAE}}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}') = \|\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{x}'\|^2 + D_{\mathrm{KL}}(N(\mu, \sigma^2) || N(0, 1))
$$

The first term is just the regular reconstruction loss we used for our autoencoder. The second term is the KL divergence between the generator's output distribution and the standard normal distribution, and it's designed to penalize the generator for producing latent vectors which are far from the standard normal distribution.

There is a much deeper way to understand this loss function, which also connects to intuitions around diffusion models and other more complicated generative models. For more on this, see the section at the end. For now, we'll move on to the practicalities of implementing this loss function.

The KL divergence of these two distributions has a closed form expression, which is given by:

$$
D_{KL}(N(\mu, \sigma^2) || N(0, 1)) = \frac{\sigma^2 + \mu^2 - 1}{2} - \log{\sigma}
$$

This is why it was important to output `mu` and `logsigma` in our forward functions, so we could compute this expression! (It's easier to use `logsigma` than `sigma` when evaluating the expression above, for stability reasons).

We won't ask you to derive this formula, because it requires understanding of **differential entropy**. However, it is worth doing some sanity checks, e.g. plot some graphs and convince yourself that this expression is larger as $\mu$ is further away from 0, or $\sigma$ is further away from 1.

One can interpret this as the penalty term to make the latent space meaningful. If all the latent vectors $\boldsymbol{z}$ you generate have each component $z_i$ normally distributed with mean 0, variance 1 (and we know they're independent because our $\epsilon_i$ we used to generate them are independent), then there will be no gaps in your latent space where you produce weird-looking output (like we saw in our autoencoder plots from the previous section). You can try training your VAE without this term, and it might do okay at reproducing $\boldsymbol{x}$, but it will perform much worse when it comes time to use it for generation. Again, you can quantify this by encoding some input data and projecting it onto the first two dimensions. When you include this term you should expect to see a nice regular cloud surrounding the origin, but without this term you might see some irregular patterns or blind spots:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/vae_latent_space.png" width="700">

Once you've computed both of these loss functions, you should add them together and perform gradient descent on them.

### Beta-VAEs

The Beta-VAE is a very simple extension of the VAE, with a different loss function: we multiply the KL Divergence term by a constant $\beta$. This helps us balance the two different loss terms. For instance, I found using $\beta = 0.1$ gave better results than the default $\beta = 1$.

### Exercise - write VAE training loop

You should spend up to 15-25 minutes on this exercise.

You should write and run your training loop below. Again, this will involve a lot of recycled code (although there's enough different between this and the autoencoder training that we recommend you define a new class, rather than using inheritance).

<summary>Help - my KL divergence is close to zero, and my reconstruction loss isn't decreasing.</summary>

This is likely because your $\beta$ is too large. In this case, your model prioritizes having its latent vectors' distribution equal to the standard normal distribution.

Your model still wants to reduce the reconstruction loss, if it can find a way to do this without changing the distribution of the latent vectors. But this might not be possible, if your model has settled into a local minimum.

---

In general, when you're optimizing two different loss functions, it's important to test out different values for their weighted average. Getting the balance wrong can lead to local minima where the model prioritizes reducing one of your loss functions, and basically ignores the other one.

Weights and biases hyperparameter searches are a good tool for this.

Once you've got your VAE working, you should go back through the exercises from your encoder (i.e. the ones where you produced plots). How different are they this time? Are your outputs any more or less faithful?

Here are some results from my VAE, from the function `visualise_output`:

Note how we have a smooth continuum over all parts of the generation space! The top-left is clearly a 7, the top-right is clearly an 8, the bottom-right is a 6, and the bottom-left seems to be merging into a 0. There are some unidentifiable shapes, but these are mostly just linear interpolations between two shapes which *are* identifiable. It certainly looks much better than our autoencoder's generative output!

Don't be disheartened if your *reconstructions of the original MNIST images* don't look as faithful for your VAE than they did for your encoder. Remember the goal of these architectures isn't to reconstruct images faithfully, it's to generate images from samples in the latent dimension. This is the basis on which you should compare your models to each other.

You can also try running `visualise_input` again, to see the scatter plot. You might need to change it slightly depending on how you implemented your VAE encoder (this function assumes your encoder outputs a tensor of shape `(2, batch_size, latent_dim_size)`, like the solution does).

A few things to note:

* The data looks more like a normal distribution, with most values in a [-2, 2] range, unlike the encoder which had very extreme values.
* The data is also more evenly spread, with fewer empty patches.

Recall, we're not looking for a crisp separation of digits here. We're only plotting 2 of 5 dimensions, it would be a coincidence if they were cleanly separated. What we're looking for is efficient use of the latent space, in a way which looks roughly like standard normal. In this plot, we do see that.

## A deeper dive into the maths of VAEs

If you're happy with the loss function as described in the section above, then you can move on from here. If you'd like to take a deeper dive into the mathematical justifications of this loss function, you can read the following content. I'd consider it pretty essential in laying the groundwork for understanding diffusion models, and most kinds of generative image models (which we might dip into later in this course).

Firstly, let's flip the model we currently have on its head. Rather than having some method of sampling images $\boldsymbol{x}$ from our image set, then having a function mapping images to latent vectors $\boldsymbol{z}$, we will start with the decoder $p_\theta$ which:
* first generates the latent vector $\boldsymbol{z}$ from distribution $p(\boldsymbol{z})$ (which we assume to be the standard normal distribution $N(0, I)$),
* then generates $\boldsymbol{x}$ from the conditional distribution $p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})$.

It may help to imagine $\boldsymbol{z}$ as being some kind of efficient encoding of all the information in our image distribution (e.g. if our images were celebrity faces, we could imagine the components of the vector $\boldsymbol{z}$ might correspond to features like gender, hair color, etc) - and $p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})$ is some kind of probabilitistic way of reconstructing faces from this information. Note the distinction here - we're assuming our decoder is a probability distribution, rather than a deterministic function like we've used above (we'll return to this point below).

We can recover the probability distribution of $\boldsymbol{x}$ by integrating over all possible values of the latent vector $\boldsymbol{z}$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\boldsymbol{x})&=\int_z p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z}) p(\boldsymbol{z}) \; d \boldsymbol{z} \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z} \sim p(\boldsymbol{z})}\big[p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})\big]
\end{aligned}
$$
We can interpret this as the probability that our decoder $p_\theta(\cdot \mid \boldsymbol{z})$ produces the image $\boldsymbol{x}$ when we feed it some noise sampled from the standard normal distribution. So all we have to do is maximize the expected value of this expression over our sample of real images $x_i$, then we're training our decoder to produce images like the ones in our set of real images, right?

Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Evaluating this integral would be computationally intractible, because we would have to sample over all possible values for the latent vectors $\boldsymbol{z}$:
$$
\theta^*=\underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmax}}\; \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \hat{p}(\boldsymbol{x}),\, \boldsymbol{z} \sim p(\boldsymbol{z})}\big[\log p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})\big]
$$
where $\hat{p}(\boldsymbol{x})$ denotes our distribution over samples of $\boldsymbol{x}$. This will take an exponentially long time to evaluate, because *we're having to sample $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{z}$ separately* - we'll only feasibly be able to capture a very small fraction of the latent space of $\boldsymbol{z}$.

*(Note, we've written $\log{p_\theta}$ here because it's usually easier to think about maximizing the log probability than the actual probability.)*

Imagine now that we had a function $q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$, which is high when **the latent vector $\boldsymbol{z}$ is likely to have been produced by $\boldsymbol{x}$**. This function would be really helpful, because for each possible value of $\boldsymbol{x}$ we would have a better idea of where to sample $\boldsymbol{z}$ from. We can represent this situation with the following **graphical model**:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/vae-graphical-light.png" width="500">

The seemingly intractible optimization problem above is replaced with a much easier one:
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\boldsymbol{x}) &=\int q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x}) \frac{p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z}) p(\boldsymbol{z})}{q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})} \;d \boldsymbol{z}\\
\theta^*&=\underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmax}}\; \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x} \sim \hat{p}(\boldsymbol{x}), \boldsymbol{z} \sim q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z}\mid \boldsymbol{x})}\left[\frac{p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})p(\boldsymbol{z})}{q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$
Note that this is exactly the same expression as before; we've just rearranged it by introducing the $q_\phi$ term, so that the distribution of $\boldsymbol{z}$ we're taking expectation over is now conditioned on $\boldsymbol{x}$.

Why is this problem easier? Because in order to estimate the quantity above, we don't need to sample a huge number of latent vectors $\boldsymbol{z}$ for each possible value of $\boldsymbol{x}$. The probability distribution $q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$ already concentrates most of our probability mass for where $\boldsymbol{z}$ should be, so we can sample according to this instead.

We now introduce an important quantity, called the **ELBO**, or **evidence lower-bound**. It is defined as follows (note that it is a function of $\boldsymbol{x}$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{x}$ is not a free variable):
$$
\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z} \sim q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\left[\log \frac{p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})p(\boldsymbol{z})}{q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\right]
$$

This is called the ELBO because it's a lower bound for the quantity $p(\boldsymbol{x})$, which we call the **evidence**. The proof for this being a lower bound comes from **Jensen's inequality**, which states that $\mathbb{E}[f(X)] \geq f(\mathbb{E}[X])$ for any convex function $f$ (and $f(\boldsymbol{x})=-\log(\boldsymbol{x})$ is convex). In fact, [we can prove](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#loss-function-elbo) the following identity holds:
$$
\log{p(\boldsymbol{x})}=\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{z} \sim q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\left[\log \frac{p(\boldsymbol{z}) p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})}{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\right]+D_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x}) \,\|\, p_\theta(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})\right)
$$
So the evidence minus the ELBO is equal to the KL divergence between the distribution $q_\phi$ and the **posterior distribution** $p_\theta(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$ (the order of $\boldsymbol{z}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}$ have been swapped). KL divergence is always non-negative, hence the lower bound.

---

Finally, this brings us to VAEs. With VAEs, we treat $p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})$ as our decoder, $q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$ as our encoder, and we train them jointly to minimise the ELBO (or rather the expected value of the ELBO over our dataset $\boldsymbol{x} \sim \hat{p}(\boldsymbol{x}))$. Using the previous identity, we see that maximizing the ELBO is equivalent to maximizing the following:
$$
\log{p(\boldsymbol{x})}-D_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x}) \,\|\, p_\theta(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})\right)
$$
In other words, we are maximizing the log-likelihood, and ***at the same time*** penalising any difference between our approximate posterior $q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$ and our true posterior $p_\theta(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$.

---

We can rewrite the ELBO in a different way:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z} \sim q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\left[\log \frac{p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z}) p(\boldsymbol{z})}{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\right] & =\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{z} \sim q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\left[\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})\right]+\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z} \sim q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\left[\log \frac{p(\boldsymbol{z})}{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\right] \\
& =\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z} \sim q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})}\left[\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{z})\right]}_{\text {reconstruction loss}}-\underbrace{D_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x}) \| p(\boldsymbol{z})\right)}_{\text {regularisation term}}
\end{aligned}
$$
which is now starting to look a lot more like (the negative of) the loss function we used earlier!
                
To further justify this claim:

* **The first term** is playing the role of reconstruction loss. This might not be obvious at first, but notice that minimising it is equivalent to *maximising the probability of the decoder reconstructing $\boldsymbol{x}$ from $\boldsymbol{z}$, given that $\boldsymbol{z}$ was itself a latent vector produced by our encoder on input $\boldsymbol{x}$*. If our model perfectly preserves $\boldsymbol{x}$ in the series of maps $\boldsymbol{x} \xrightarrow{\text{encoder}} \boldsymbol{z} \xrightarrow{\text{decoder}} \boldsymbol{x}$ then this reconstruction loss term would be zero (because the probability would be 1, and the logprob would be 0). In fact, we can just swap this term out for any reasonable reconstruction loss (for instance, the $l_2$ loss that we used in the last section) - and that's exactly what we did!

* **The second term** is the KL divergence between$q_\phi(\boldsymbol{z} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$ (the distribution of latent vectors produced by your VAE when given inputs $\boldsymbol{x}$) and $p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{z})$ (the true generative distribution of latent vectors $\boldsymbol{z}$). Note that both of these distributions are known to us - the first is normal with mean $\mu(\boldsymbol{x})$ and variance $\sigma(\boldsymbol{x})^2$, and the second is just the standard normal distribution with mean 0, variance 1 (see [Figure 6](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#beta-vae:~:text=.-,Fig.%206.,-The%20graphical%20model) in the blog post). So this term is exactly equal to the KL divergence term in our loss function.

The decoder used in our VAE isn't actually probabilistic $p_\theta(\cdot \mid \boldsymbol{z})$, it's deterministic (i.e. it's a map from latent vector $\boldsymbol{z}$ to reconstructed input $\boldsymbol{x}'$). But we can pretend that the decoder output is actually the mean of a probability distribution, and we're choosing this mean as the value of our reconstruction $\boldsymbol{x}'$. The reconstruction loss term in the formula above will be smallest when this mean is close to the original value $\boldsymbol{x}$ (because then $p_\theta(\cdot \mid \boldsymbol{z})$ will be a probability distribution centered around $\boldsymbol{x}$). And it turns out that we can just replace this reconstruction loss with something that fulfils basically the same purpose (the $L_2$ penalty) - although we sometimes need to adjust these two terms (see $\beta$-VAEs above).

And that's the math of VAEs in a nutshell!

## Bonus exercises

### PCA

In the code earlier, we visualised our autoencoder / VAE output along the first two dimensions of the latent space. If each dimension is perfectly IID then we should expect this to get similar results to varying along any two arbitrarily chosen orthogonal directions. However, in practice you might find it an improvement to choose directions in a more principled way. One way to do this is to use **principal component analysis** (PCA). Can you write code to extract the PCA components from your model's latent space, and plot the data along these components?

<details>
<summary>Template (code for extracting PCA from the Autoencoder)</summary>

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

@t.inference_mode()
def get_pca_components(
    model: Autoencoder,
    dataset: Dataset,
) -> Tuple[t.Tensor, t.Tensor, t.Tensor]:
    '''
    Gets the first 2 principal components in latent space, from the data.

    Returns:
        pca_vectors: shape (2, latent_dim_size)
            the first 2 principal component vectors in latent space
        principal_components: shape (batch_size, 2)
            components of data along the first 2 principal components
    '''
    # Unpack the (small) dataset into a single batch
    imgs = t.stack([batch[0] for batch in dataset]).to(device)
    labels = t.tensor([batch[1] for batch in dataset])

    # Get the latent vectors
    latent_vectors = model.encoder(imgs.to(device)).cpu().numpy()
    if latent_vectors.ndim == 3: latent_vectors = latent_vectors[0] # useful for VAEs; see later

    # Perform PCA, to get the principle component directions (& projections of data in these directions)
    pca = PCA(n_components=2)
    principal_components = pca.fit_transform(latent_vectors)
    pca_vectors = pca.components_
    return (
        t.from_numpy(pca_vectors).float(),
        t.from_numpy(principal_components).float(),
    )
```

And then you can use this function in your `visualise_output` by replacing the code at the start with this:

```python
pca_vectors, principal_components = get_pca_components(model, dataset)

# Constructing latent dim data by making two of the dimensions vary independently in the interpolation range
x = t.linspace(*interpolation_range, n_points)
grid_latent = t.stack([
    einops.repeat(x, "dim1 -> dim1 dim2", dim2=n_points),
    einops.repeat(x, "dim2 -> dim1 dim2", dim1=n_points),
], dim=-1)
# Map grid to the basis of the PCA components
grid_latent = grid_latent @ pca_vectors
```

Note that this will require adding `dataset` to the arguments of this function.

You can do something similar for the `visualise_input` function:

```python
@t.inference_mode()
def visualise_input(
    model: Autoencoder,
    dataset: Dataset,
) -> None:
    '''
    Visualises (in the form of a scatter plot) the input data in the latent space, along the first two latent dims.
    '''
    # First get the model images' latent vectors, along first 2 dims
    imgs = t.stack([batch for batch, label in dataset]).to(device)
    latent_vectors = model.encoder(imgs)
    if latent_vectors.ndim == 3: latent_vectors = latent_vectors[0] # useful for VAEs later
    latent_vectors = latent_vectors[:, :2].cpu().numpy()
    labels = [str(label) for img, label in dataset]

    # Make a dataframe for scatter (px.scatter is more convenient to use when supplied with a dataframe)
    df = pd.DataFrame({"dim1": latent_vectors[:, 0], "dim2": latent_vectors[:, 1], "label": labels})
    df = df.sort_values(by="label")
    fig = px.scatter(df, x="dim1", y="dim2", color="label")
    fig.update_layout(height=700, width=700, title="Scatter plot of latent space dims", legend_title="Digit")
    data_range = df["dim1"].max() - df["dim1"].min()

    # Add images to the scatter plot (optional)
    output_on_data_to_plot = model.encoder(HOLDOUT_DATA.to(device))
    if output_on_data_to_plot.ndim == 3: output_on_data_to_plot = output_on_data_to_plot[0] # useful for VAEs later
    output_on_data_to_plot = output_on_data_to_plot[:, :2].cpu()
    data_translated = (HOLDOUT_DATA.cpu().numpy() * 0.3081) + 0.1307
    data_translated = (255 * data_translated).astype(np.uint8).squeeze()
    for i in range(10):
        x, y = output_on_data_to_plot[i]
        fig.add_layout_image(
            source=Image.fromarray(data_translated[i]).convert("L"),
            xref="x", yref="y",
            x=x, y=y,
            xanchor="right", yanchor="top",
            sizex=data_range/15, sizey=data_range/15,
        )

### Beta-VAEs

Read the section on [Beta-VAEs](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#beta-vae), if you haven't already. Can you choose a better value for $\beta$?

To decide on an appropriate $\beta$, you can look at the distribution of your latent vector. For instance, if your latent vector looks very different to the standard normal distribution when it's projected onto one of its components (e.g. maybe that component is very sharply spiked around some particular value), this is a sign that you need to use a larger parameter $\beta$. You can also just use hyperparameter searches to find an optimal $\beta$. See [the paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl) which introduced Beta-VAEs for more ideas.

### CelebA dataset

Try to build an autoencoder for the CelebA dataset. You shouldn't need to change the architecture much from your MNIST VAE. You should find the training much easier than with your GAN (as discussed yesterday, GANs are notoriously unstable when it comes to training). Can you get better results than you did for your GAN?

### Hierarchical VAEs

Hierarchical VAEs are ones which stack multiple layers of parameter-learning and latent-vector-sampling, rather than just doing this once. Read the section of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11970.pdf) for a more thorough description.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/vae-and-hvae-light.png" width="1100">

(Note - the KL divergence loss used in HVAEs can sometimes be more complicated than the one presented in this diagram, if you want to implement conditional dependencies between the different layers. However, this isn't necessary for the basic HVAE architecture.)

Try to implement your own hierarchical VAE.

Note - when you get to the material on **diffusion models** later in the course, you might want to return here, because understanding HVAEs can be a useful step to understanding diffusion models. In fact diffusion models can almost be thought of as a special type of HVAE.

### Denoising and sparse autoencoders

The reading material on VAEs talks about [denoising](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#denoising-autoencoder) and [sparse](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#sparse-autoencoder) autoencoders. Try changing the architecture of your autoencoder (not your VAE) to test out one of these two techniques. Do does your decoder output change? How about your encoder scatter plot?

***Note - sparse autoencoders will play an important role in some later sections of this course (when we study superposition in mechanistic interpretability).***

If you're mathematically confident and feeling like a challenge, you can also try to implement [contractive autoencoders](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#contractive-autoencoder)!
