This page contains important prerequisites for the rest of the material in this chapter. The first page **Core Concepts / Knowledge** is a long list of important concepts and libraries that you should be familiar with before starting the rest of the material. The second page **Einops, Einsum & Tensor Manipulation** provides some coding exercises to help you get familiar with the `einops` and `einsum` libraries, as well as some exercises on indexing and other aspects of tensor manipulation. We anticipate adding more exercises here in the future, in the style of the second page.

See the homepage for more instructions on how to set up your environment, and install all the dependencies you need to run the exercises.
