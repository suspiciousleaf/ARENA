## Introduction

In today's exercises, we will explore various optimization algorithms and their roles in training deep learning models. We will delve into the inner workings of different optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), RMSprop, and Adam, and learn how to implement them using code. Additionally, we will discuss the concept of loss landscapes and their significance in visualizing the challenges faced during the optimization process. By the end of this set of exercises, you will have a solid understanding of optimization algorithms and their impact on model performance. We'll also take a look at Weights and Biases, a tool that can be used to track and visualize the training process, and test different values of hyperparameters to find the most effective ones.

## Content & Learning Objectives

### Optimizers

These exercises will take you through how different optimization algorithms work (specifically SGD, RMSprop and Adam). You'll write your own optimisers, and use plotting functions to visualise gradient descent on loss landscapes.

> ##### Learning Objectives
> 
> * Understand how different optimization algorithms work
> * Translate pseudocode for these algorithms into code
> * Understand the idea of loss landscapes, and how they can visualize specific challenges in the optimization process

### Weights and Biases

In this section, we'll look at methods for choosing hyperparameters effectively. You'll learn how to use **Weights and Biases**, a useful tool for hyperparameter search. By the end of today, you should be able to use Weights and Biases to train the ResNet you created in the last set of exercises.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> * Learn what the most important hyperparameters are, and methods for efficiently searching over hyperparameter space
> * Adapt your code from yesterday to log training runs to Weights & Biases, and use this service to run hyperparameter sweeps

### Bonus

This section gives you suggestions for further exploration of optimizers, and Weights & Biases.
