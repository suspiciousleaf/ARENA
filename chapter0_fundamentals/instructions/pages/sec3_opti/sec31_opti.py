## Gradient Descent

Tomorrow, we'll look in detail about how the backpropagation algorithm works. But for now, let's take it as read that calling `loss.backward()` on a scalar `loss` will result in the computation of the gradients $\frac{\partial loss}{\partial w}$ for every parameter `w` in the model, and store these values in `w.grad`. How do we use these gradients to update our parameters in a way which decreases loss?


A loss function can be any differentiable function such that we prefer a lower value. To apply gradient descent, we start by initializing the parameters to random values (the details of this are subtle), and then repeatedly compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters. It [can be proven](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DirectionalDeriv.aspx) that for an infinitesimal step, moving in the direction of the gradient would increase the loss by the largest amount out of all possible directions.

We actually want to decrease the loss, so we subtract the gradient to go in the opposite direction. Taking infinitesimal steps is no good, so we pick some learning rate $\lambda$ (also called the step size) and scale our step by that amount to obtain the update rule for gradient descent:

$$\theta_t \leftarrow \theta_{t-1} - \lambda \nabla L(\theta_{t-1})$$

We know that an infinitesimal step will decrease the loss, but a finite step will only do so if the loss function is linear enough in the neighbourhood of the current parameters. If the loss function is too curved, we might actually increase our loss.

The biggest advantage of this algorithm is that for N bytes of parameters, you only need N additional bytes of memory to store the gradients, which are of the same shape as the parameters. GPU memory is very limited, so this is an extremely relevant consideration. The amount of computation needed is also minimal: one multiply and one add per parameter.

The biggest disadvantage is that we're completely ignoring the curvature of the loss function, not captured by the gradient consisting of partial derivatives. Intuitively, we can take a larger step if the loss function is flat in some direction or a smaller step if it is very curved. Generally, you could represent this by some matrix P that pre-multiplies the gradients to rescale them to account for the curvature. $P$ is called a preconditioner, and gradient descent is equivalent to approximating $P$ by an identity matrix, which is a very bad approximation.

Most competing optimizers can be interpreted as trying to do something more sensible for $P$, subject to the constraint that GPU memory is at a premium. In particular, constructing $P$ explicitly is infeasible, since it's an $N \times N$ matrix and N can be hundreds of billions. One idea is to use a diagonal $P$, which only requires N additional memory. An example of a more sophisticated scheme is [Shampoo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09568.pdf).

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

The terms gradient descent and SGD are used loosely in deep learning. To be technical, there are three variations:

- Batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss over the entire dataset. This requires too much computation unless the dataset is small, so it is rarely used in deep learning.
- Stochastic gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a randomly selected example. Any particular loss may be completely in the wrong direction of the loss on the entire dataset, but in expectation it's in the right direction. This has some nice properties but doesn't parallelize well, so it is rarely used in deep learning.
- Mini-batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a batch of examples of size `batch_size`. This is the standard in deep learning.

The class `torch.optim.SGD` can be used for any of these by varying the number of examples passed in. We will be using only mini-batch gradient descent in this course.

## Batch Size

In addition to choosing a learning rate or learning rate schedule, we need to choose the batch size or batch size schedule as well. Intuitively, using a larger batch means that the estimate of the gradient is closer to that of the true gradient over the entire dataset, but this requires more compute. Each element of the batch can be computed in parallel so with sufficient compute, one can increase the batch size without increasing wall-clock time. For small-scale experiments, a good heuristic is thus "fill up all of your GPU memory".

At a larger scale, we would expect diminishing returns of increasing the batch size, but empirically it's worse than that - a batch size that is too large generalizes more poorly in many scenarios. The intuition that a closer approximation to the true gradient is always better is therefore incorrect. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) for one discussion of this.

For a batch size schedule, most commonly you'll see batch sizes increase over the course of training. The intuition is that a rough estimate of the proper direction is good enough early in training, but later in training it's important to preserve our progress and not "bounce around" too much.

You will commonly see batch sizes that are a multiple of 32. One motivation for this is that when using CUDA, threads are grouped into "warps" of 32 threads which execute the same instructions in parallel. So a batch size of 64 would allow two warps to be fully utilized, whereas a size of 65 would require waiting for a third warp to finish. As batch sizes become larger, this wastage becomes less important.

Powers of two are also common - the idea here is that work can be recursively divided up among different GPUs or within a GPU. For example, a matrix multiplication can be expressed by recursively dividing each matrix into four equal blocks and performing eight smaller matrix multiplications between the blocks.

In tomorrow's exercises, you'll have the option to expore batch sizes in more detail.

## Common Themes in Gradient-Based Optimizers

### Weight Decay

Weight decay means that on each iteration, in addition to a regular step, we also shrink each parameter very slightly towards 0 by multiplying a scaling factor close to 1, e.g. 0.9999. Empirically, this seems to help but there are no proofs that apply to deep neural networks.

In the case of linear regression, weight decay is mathematically equivalent to having a prior that each parameter is Gaussian distributed - in other words it's very unlikely that the true parameter values are very positive or very negative. This is an example of "**inductive bias**" - we make an assumption that helps us in the case where it's justified, and hurts us in the case where it's not justified.

For a `Linear` layer, it's common practice to apply weight decay only to the weight and not the bias. It's also common to not apply weight decay to the parameters of a batch normalization layer. Again, there is empirical evidence (such as [Jai et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf)) and there are heuristic arguments to justify these choices, but no rigorous proofs. Note that PyTorch will implement weight decay on the weights *and* biases of linear layers by default - see the bonus exercises tomorrow for more on this.

### Momentum

Momentum means that the step includes a term proportional to a moving average of past gradients. [Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) has a great article on momentum, which you should definitely read if you have time. Don't worry if you don't understand all of it; skimming parts of it can be very informative. For instance, the first half discusses the **conditioning number** (a very important concept to understand in optimisation), and concludes by giving an intuitive argument for why we generally set the momentum parameter close to 1 for ill-conditioned problems (those with a very large conditioning number).

## Visualising optimization with pathological curvatures

A pathological curvature is a type of surface that is similar to ravines and is particularly tricky for plain SGD optimization. In words, pathological curvatures typically have a steep gradient in one direction with an optimum at the center, while in a second direction we have a slower gradient towards a (global) optimum. Let’s first create an example surface of this and visualize it:

```python
def pathological_curve_loss(x: t.Tensor, y: t.Tensor):
    # Example of a pathological curvature. There are many more possible, feel free to experiment here!
    x_loss = t.tanh(x) ** 2 + 0.01 * t.abs(x)
    y_loss = t.sigmoid(y)
    return x_loss + y_loss


plot_fn(pathological_curve_loss)
```

In terms of optimization, you can image that `x` and `y` are weight parameters, and the curvature represents the loss surface over the space of `x` and `y`. Note that in typical networks, we have many, many more parameters than two, and such curvatures can occur in multi-dimensional spaces as well.

Ideally, our optimization algorithm would find the center of the ravine and focuses on optimizing the parameters towards the direction of `y`. However, if we encounter a point along the ridges, the gradient is much greater in `x` than `y`, and we might end up jumping from one side to the other. Due to the large gradients, we would have to reduce our learning rate slowing down learning significantly.

To test our algorithms, we can implement a simple function to train two parameters on such a surface.


### Exercise - implement `opt_fn_with_sgd`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

Implement the `opt_fn_with_sgd` function using `torch.optim.SGD`. Starting from `(2.5, 2.5)`, run your function and add the resulting trajectory of `(x, y)` pairs to your contour plot. Did it find the minimum? Play with the learning rate and momentum a bit and see how close you can get within 100 iterations.

You'll need to repeat the following loop:

* Calculate your output (equivalent to altitude in your loss landscape, at coordinates `(x, y)`)
* Call `.backward()` on your output, to propagate gradients (more on this tomorrow!)
* Call `.step()` on your optimizer, to update your parameters
* Call `.zero_grad()` on your optimizer, to zero out the gradients from the previous step, ready to restart the loop

A few gotchas:

* `torch.optim.SGD` (and other optimizers you'll use) expect iterables of parameters, rather than a single parameter. So rather than passing in the tensor `xy` as the `params` argument, you need to pass in a length-1 list containing `xy`.
* Remember to call `detach()` on your `xy` tensor at each step before you add it to your list of points. This is necessary to remove `xy` it from the computational graph.
* An important note here - we're not optimising the parameters of a neural network; we're optimising parameters `(x, y)` which represent coordinates at which we evaluate a function.


```python
def opt_fn_with_sgd(fn: Callable, xy: t.Tensor, lr=0.001, momentum=0.98, n_iters: int = 100):
    '''
    Optimize the a given function starting from the specified point.

    xy: shape (2,). The (x, y) starting point.
    n_iters: number of steps.
    lr, momentum: parameters passed to the torch.optim.SGD optimizer.

    Return: (n_iters, 2). The (x,y) BEFORE each step. So out[0] is the starting point.
    '''
    pass
```

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm not sure if my <code>opt_fn_with_sgd</code> is implemented properly.</summary>

With a learning rate of `0.02` and momentum of `0.99`, my SGD was able to reach `[ 0.8110, -6.3344]` after 100 iterations.
</details>
 
<details>
<summary>Help - I'm getting <code>Can't call numpy() on Tensor that requires grad</code>.</summary>

This is a protective mechanism built into PyTorch. The idea is that once you convert your Tensor to NumPy, PyTorch can no longer track gradients, but you might not understand this and expect backprop to work on NumPy arrays.

All you need to do to convince PyTorch you're a responsible adult is to call detach() on the tensor first, which returns a view that does not require grad and isn't part of the computation graph.

    '''
    # SOLUTION

    xys = t.zeros((n_iters, 2))

    # YOUR CODE HERE: run optimization, and populate `xys` with the coordinates before each step
    optimizer = optim.SGD([xy], lr=lr, momentum=momentum)

    for i in range(n_iters):
        xys[i] = xy.detach()
        out = fn(xy[0], xy[1])
        out.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
    return xys
```
</details>
 


We've also provided you with a function `plot_fn_with_points`, which plots a function as well as a list of points produced by functions like the one above. It works as follows:


```python
points = []

optimizer_list = [
    (optim.SGD, {"lr": 0.1, "momentum": 0.0}),
    (optim.SGD, {"lr": 0.02, "momentum": 0.99}),
]

for optimizer_class, params in optimizer_list:
    xy = t.tensor([2.5, 2.5], requires_grad=True)
    xys = opt_fn_with_sgd(pathological_curve_loss, xy=xy, lr=params['lr'], momentum=params['momentum'])

    points.append((xys, optimizer_class, params))

plot_fn_with_points(pathological_curve_loss, points=points)
```

## Build Your Own Optimizers

Now let's build our own drop-in replacement for these three classes from `torch.optim`. The documentation pages for these algorithms have pseudocode you can use to implement your step method.


> **A warning regarding in-place operations**
> 
> Be careful with expressions like `x = x + y` and `x += y`. They are NOT equivalent in Python.
> 
> - The first one allocates a new `Tensor` of the appropriate size and adds `x` and `y` to it, then rebinds `x` to point to the new variable. The original `x` is not modified.
> - The second one modifies the storage referred to by `x` to contain the sum of `x` and `y` - it is an "in-place" operation.
>     - Another way to write the in-place operation is `x.add_(y)` (the trailing underscore indicates an in-place operation).
>     - A third way to write the in-place operation is `torch.add(x, y, out=x)`.
> - This is rather subtle, so make sure you are clear on the difference. This isn't specific to PyTorch; the built-in Python `list` follows similar behavior: `x = x + y` allocates a new list, while `x += y` is equivalent to `x.extend(y)`.
> 
> The tricky thing that happens here is that both the optimizer and the `Module` in your model have a reference to the same `Parameter` instance. 


<details>
<summary>Question - do you think we should use in-place operations in our optimizer?</summary>

You MUST use in-place operations in your optimizer because we want the model to see the change to the Parameter's storage on the next forward pass. If your optimizer allocates a new tensor, the model won't know anything about the new tensor and will continue to use the old, unmodified version.

Note, this observation specifically refers to the parameters. When you're updating non-parameter variables that you're tracking, you should be careful not to accidentally use an in-place operation where you shouldn't!.
</details>


### Exercise - implement `SGD`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 25-35 minutes on this exercise.

This is the first of several exercises like it. The first will probably take the longest.
```

First, you should implement stochastic gradient descent. It should be like the [PyTorch version](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html#torch.optim.SGD), but assume `nesterov=False`, `maximize=False`, and `dampening=0`. These simplifications mean that there are many variables in the pseudocode at that link which you can ignore.

A few notes / tips (most of these apply to all the implementations, not just SGD):

- The values $\theta_t$ in this pseudocode represent each of the parameters within the list `params`, and the values $g_t$ represent the gradients.
- When you zero the gradients, you'll need to iterate over all parameters in `params` and set the gradient to zero.
    - Alternatively, you can set `param.grad` to `None` - this has the same effect, but is generally preferred for storage reasons. The next time `backward` is called, the `grad` attribute will be allocated a value just like it would be if it was initially a tensor of zeros.
- Your step function shouldn't modify the gradients. This is why we have the decorator `@torch.inference_mode()` (which is equivalent to using the context manager `with torch.inference_mode():`.
    - This is similar to `torch.no_grad`, however `torch.inference_mode` is now generally preferred.
- If you create any new tensors, they should be on the same device as the corresponding parameter. Use `torch.zeros_like()` or similar for this.
- Be careful not to mix up `Parameter` and `Tensor` types in this step. The parameters in `params` are of type `Parameter`, but each `param.grad` should be of type `Tensor`.

This is a challenging exercise, so we strongly recommend using the hints (STEP 1 and STEP 2) below. You might also want to look at the solution if you're really stuck, and once you have an idea of how these classes are meant to work, try implementing one of the other optimizers without hints.

```python
class SGD:
    def __init__(
        self, 
        params: Iterable[t.nn.parameter.Parameter], 
        lr: float, 
        momentum: float = 0.0, 
        weight_decay: float = 0.0
    ):
        '''Implements SGD with momentum.

        Like the PyTorch version, but assume nesterov=False, maximize=False, and dampening=0
            https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html#torch.optim.SGD

        '''
        params = list(params) # turn params into a list (because it might be a generator)
        pass

    def zero_grad(self) -> None:
        '''Zeros all gradients of the parameters in `self.params`.
        '''
        pass

    @t.inference_mode()
    def step(self) -> None:
        '''Performs a single optimization step of the SGD algorithm.
        '''
        pass

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"SGD(lr={self.lr}, momentum={self.mu}, weight_decay={self.lmda})"


tests.test_sgd(SGD)
```

The configurations used during testing will start simple (e.g. all parameters set to zero except `lr`) and gradually move to more complicated ones. This will help you track exactly where in your model the error is coming from.

If you've having trouble, you can use the following process when implementing your optimisers:

1. Take the pseudocode from the PyTorch documentation page, and write out the "simple version", i.e. without all of the extra variables which you won't need. (It's good practice to be able to parse pseudocode and figure out what it actually means - during the course we'll be doing a lot more of "transcribing instructions / formulae from paper into code"). You'll want pen and paper for this!

2. Figure out which extra variables you'll need to track within your class.

3. Implement the `step` function using these variables.

You can click on the expander below to see what the first two steps look like for the case of SGD (try and have a go at each step before you look).


<details>
<summary>STEP 1</summary>

In the SGD pseudocode, you'll first notice that we can remove the nesterov section, i.e. we always do $g_t \leftarrow \boldsymbol{b}_t$. Then, we can actually remove the variable $\boldsymbol{b_t}$ altogether (because we only needed it to track values while implementing nesterov). Lastly, we have `maximize=False` and `dampening=0`, which allows us to further simplify. So we get the simplified pseudocode:

$
\text {for } t=1 \text { to } \ldots \text { do } \\
\quad g_t \leftarrow \nabla_\theta f_t\left(\theta_{t-1}\right) \\
\quad \text {if } \lambda \neq 0 \\
\quad\quad g_t \leftarrow g_t+\lambda \theta_{t-1} \\
\quad \text {if } \mu \neq 0 \text{ and } t>1 \\
\quad\quad g_t \leftarrow \mu g_{t-1} + g_t \\
\quad \theta_t \leftarrow \theta_{t-1} - \gamma g_t
$

Note - you might find it helpful to name your variables in the `__init__` step in line with their definitions in the pseudocode, e.g. `self.mu = momentum`. This will make it easier to implement the `step` function.
</details>
 
<details>
<summary>STEP 2</summary>

In the formula from STEP 1, $\theta_t$ represents the parameters themselves, and $g_t$ represents variables which we need to keep track of in order to implement momentum. We need to track $g_t$ in our model, e.g. using a line like:

```python
self.gs = [t.zeros_like(p) for p in self.params]
```

We also need to track the variable $t$, because the behavour is different when $t=0$. (Technically we could just as easily not do this, because the behaviour when $t=0$ is just the same as the behaviour when $g_t=0$ and $t>0$. But I've left $t$ in my solutions, to make it more obvious how the `SGD.step` function corrsponds to the pseudocode shown in STEP 1.

Now, you should be in a good position to attempt the third step: applying SGD in the `step` function, using this algorithm and these tracked variables.

If you feel comfortable with this implementation, you can skim through the remaining ones, since there's diminishing marginal returns to be gained from doing the actual exercises.

### Exercise - implement `RMSprop`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪

You should spend up to 15-25 minutes on this exercise.
```

Once you've implemented SGD, you should do RMSprop in a similar way. Although the pseudocode is more complicated and there are more variables you'll have to track, there is no big conceptual difference between the task for RMSprop and SGD.

If you want to better understand why RMSprop works, then you can return to some of the readings at the top of this page.

        self,
        params: Iterable[t.nn.parameter.Parameter],

### Exercise - implement `Adam`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

Next, you'll do the same for Adam. This is a very popular optimizer in deep learning, which empirically often outperforms most others. It combines the heuristics of both momentum (via the $\beta_1$ parameter), and RMSprop's handling of noisy data by dividing by the $l_2$ norm of gradients (via the $\beta_2$ parameter).

### Exercise - implement `AdamW`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

Finally, you'll adapt your Adam implementation to implement AdamW. This is a variant of Adam which is designed to work better with decoupled weight decay. You can read more about it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101). If you have time, we strongly recommend reading this paper - it is fairly accessible and forces you to engage with what Adam is actually doing.

[Here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.AdamW.html) is a link to the PyTorch version.

<details>
<summary>Question - can you see why AdamW is different to Adam with weight decay, from the PyTorch documentation pages?</summary>

The answer lies in how the weight decay parameter $\lambda$ is used. In Adam, weight decay is applied to the gradients (before first and second moments are calculated), whereas in AdamW weight decay is applied to the weights themselves (moving them back towards zero).

The way AdamW implements weight decay is now generally seen as the "correct" way to do it (at least, it's more correct to use the name "weight decay" to describe the `weight_decay` hyperparameter in AdamW than to describe the hyperparameter in Adam).

```python
class AdamW:
    def __init__(
        self,
        params: Iterable[t.nn.parameter.Parameter],

## Plotting multiple optimisers

Finally, we've provided some code which should allow you to plot more than one of your optimisers at once.


### Exercise - implement `opt_fn`

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

First, you should fill in this function. It will be pretty much exactly the same as your `opt_fn_with_sgd` from earlier, the only difference is that this function works when passed an arbitrary optimizer (you should only have to change one line of code from your previous function). The `optimizer_hyperparams` argument is a dictionary which will contain keywords like `lr` and `momentum`.


```python
def opt_fn(fn: Callable, xy: t.Tensor, optimizer_class, optimizer_hyperparams: dict, n_iters: int = 100):
    '''Optimize the a given function starting from the specified point.

    optimizer_class: one of the optimizers you've defined, either SGD, RMSprop, or Adam
    optimzer_kwargs: keyword arguments passed to your optimiser (e.g. lr and weight_decay)
    '''
    pass


```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


```python
def opt_fn(fn: Callable, xy: t.Tensor, optimizer_class, optimizer_hyperparams: dict, n_iters: int = 100):
    '''Optimize the a given function starting from the specified point.

    optimizer_class: one of the optimizers you've defined, either SGD, RMSprop, or Adam
    optimzer_kwargs: keyword arguments passed to your optimiser (e.g. lr and weight_decay)
    '''
    # SOLUTION
    assert xy.requires_grad

    xys = t.zeros((n_iters, 2))
    optimizer = optimizer_class([xy], **optimizer_hyperparams)

    for i in range(n_iters):
        xys[i] = xy.detach()
        out = fn(xy[0], xy[1])
        out.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    return xys
```
</details>


Once you've implemented this function, you can use `utils.plot_optimization` to create plots of multiple different optimizers at once. An example of how this should work can be found below.


```python
points = []

optimizer_list = [
    (SGD, {"lr": 0.03, "momentum": 0.99}),
    (RMSprop, {"lr": 0.02, "alpha": 0.99, "momentum": 0.8}),
    (Adam, {"lr": 0.2, "betas": (0.99, 0.99), "weight_decay": 0.005}),
]

for optimizer_class, params in optimizer_list:
    xy = t.tensor([2.5, 2.5], requires_grad=True)
    xys = opt_fn(pathological_curve_loss, xy=xy, optimizer_class=optimizer_class, optimizer_hyperparams=params)
    points.append((xys, optimizer_class, params))

plot_fn_with_points(pathological_curve_loss, points=points)
```

You can try and play around with a few optimisers. 

* Which ones perform best for this particular function? 
* Which ones become unstable when you increase their learning rates?
* With the same parameters, does `AdamW` beat `Adam`?

Here are a few functions you might also want to try out:


```python
def bivariate_gaussian(x, y, x_mean=0.0, y_mean=0.0, x_sig=1.0, y_sig=1.0):
    norm = 1 / (2 * np.pi * x_sig * y_sig)
    x_exp = (-1 * (x - x_mean) ** 2) / (2 * x_sig**2)
    y_exp = (-1 * (y - y_mean) ** 2) / (2 * y_sig**2)
    return norm * t.exp(x_exp + y_exp)

def neg_trimodal_func(x, y):
    z = -bivariate_gaussian(x, y, x_mean=1.0, y_mean=-0.5, x_sig=0.2, y_sig=0.2)
    z -= bivariate_gaussian(x, y, x_mean=-1.0, y_mean=0.5, x_sig=0.2, y_sig=0.2)
    z -= bivariate_gaussian(x, y, x_mean=-0.5, y_mean=-0.8, x_sig=0.2, y_sig=0.2)
    return z


plot_fn(neg_trimodal_func, x_range=(-2, 2), y_range=(-2, 2))
```

```python
def rosenbrocks_banana_func(x: t.Tensor, y: t.Tensor, a=1, b=100) -> t.Tensor:
    return (a - x) ** 2 + b * (y - x**2) ** 2 + 1


plot_fn(rosenbrocks_banana_func, x_range=(-2, 2), y_range=(-1, 3), log_scale=True)
```

<details>
<summary>Spoiler - what you should find</summary>

For most of these functions, you should find that Adam performs much better. We can increase the learning rate of Adam without losing stability (provided the betas are well-chosen). The Rosenbrocks banana is a well-known exception, which causes most optimizers to perform badly (SGD with very high momentum is pretty much the only thing that works). 

What is our conclusion here? Should we always use Adam and never look at SGD anymore? The short answer: no. There are many papers saying that in certain situations, SGD (with momentum) generalizes better, where Adam often tends to overfit. Nevertheless, Adam is the most commonly used optimizer in Deep Learning as it usually performs better than other optimizers, especially for deep networks. Furthermore, we usually just stick with the default Adam parameters of `lr=0.001`, `betas=(0.9, 0.999)`, and `eps=1e-8`, which are usually good enough for most problems.

## Bonus - parameter groups


> *If you're interested in these exercises then you can go through them, if not then you can move on to the next section (weights and biases).*


Rather than passing a single iterable of parameters into an optimizer, you have the option to pass a list of parameter groups, each one with different hyperparameters. As an example of how this might work:

```python
optim.SGD([
    {'params': model.base.parameters()},
    {'params': model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-3}
], lr=1e-2, momentum=0.9)
```

The first argument here is a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary defining a separate parameter group. Each should contain a `params` key, which contains an iterable of parameters belonging to this group. The dictionaries may also contain keyword arguments. If a parameter is not specified in a group, PyTorch uses the value passed as a keyword argument. So the example above is equivalent to:

```python
optim.SGD([
    {'params': model.base.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-2, 'momentum': 0.9},
    {'params': model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-3, 'momentum': 0.9}
])
```

PyTorch optimisers will store all their params and hyperparams in the `param_groups` attribute, which is a list of dictionaries like the one above, where each one contains *every* hyperparameter rather than just the ones that were specified by the user at initialisation. Optimizers will have this `param_groups` attribute even if they only have one param group - then `param_groups` will just be a list containing a single dictionary.


### When to use parameter groups

Parameter groups can be useful in several different circumstances. A few examples:

* Finetuning a model by freezing earlier layers and only training later layers is an extreme form of parameter grouping. We can use the parameter group syntax to apply a modified form, where the earlier layers have a smaller learning rate. This allows these earlier layers to adapt to the specifics of the problem, while making sure they don't forget all the useful features they've already learned.
* Often it's good to treat weights and biases differently, e.g. effects like weight decay are often applied to weights but not biases. PyTorch doesn't differentiate between these two, so you'll have to do this manually using paramter groups.
    * This in particular, you might be doing later in the course, if you choose the "train BERT from scratch" exercises during the transformers chapter.
* On the subject of transformers, weight decay is often *not* applied to embeddings and layernorms in transformer models.

More generally, if you're trying to replicate a paper, it's important to be able to use all the same training details that the original authors did, so you can get the same results.


### Exercise - rewrite SGD to use parameter groups

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.

It's valuable to conceptually understand parameter groups. This exercise has many less important finnicky details, when creating the param groups dictionary.
```

You should rewrite the `SGD` optimizer from the earlier exercises, to use `param_groups`. A few things to keep in mind during this exercise:

* The learning rate must either be specified as a keyword argument, or it must be specified in every group. If it isn't specified as a keyword argument or there's at least one group in which it's not specified, you should raise an error.
    * This isn't true for the other hyperparameters like momentum. They all have default values, and so they don't need to be specified.
* You should add some code to check that no parameters appear in more than one group (PyTorch raises an error if this happens).
