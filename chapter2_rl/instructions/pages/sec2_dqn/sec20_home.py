## Introduction

In this section, you'll implement Deep Q-Learning, often referred to as DQN for "Deep Q-Network". This was used in a landmark paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf).

At the time, the idea that convolutional neural networks could look at Atari game pixels and "see" gameplay-relevant features like a Space Invader was new and noteworthy. In 2022, we take for granted that convnets work, so we're going to focus on the RL aspect and not the vision aspect today.



## Content & Learning Objectives

#### 1️⃣ Q-Learning

Now, we deal with situations where the environment is a black-box, and the agent must learn the rules of the world via interaction with it. This is different from everything else we've done so far, e.g. in the previous section we could calculate optimal policies by using the tensors $R$ and $T$, which we will now assume the agent doesn't have direct knowledge of.

We call algorithms which have access to the transition probability distribution and reward function **model-based algorithms**. **Q-learning** is a **model-free algorithm**. From the original paper introducing Q-learning:

*[Q-learning] provides agents with the capability of learning to act optimally in Markovian domains by experiencing the consequences of actions, without requiring them to build maps of the domains.*

> ##### Learning objectives
>
> - Understand the basic Q-learning algorithm
> - Implement SARSA and Q-Learning, and compare them on different envionments
> - Understand the difference between model-based and model-free algorithms
> - Learn more about exploration vs exploitation, and create an epsilon-greedy policy based on your Q-values

#### 2️⃣ DQN

In this section, you'll implement Deep Q-Learning, often referred to as DQN for "Deep Q-Network". This was used in a landmark paper Playing Atari with [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf).

You'll apply the technique of DQN to master the famous CartPole environment (below), and then (if you have time) move on to harder challenges like Acrobot and MountainCar.

> ##### Learning objectives
>
> - Understand the DQN algorithm
> - Learn more about RL debugging, and build probe environments to debug your agents
> - Create a replay buffer to store environment transitions
> - Implement DQN using PyTorch Lightning, on the CartPole environment

## Note on `gym` vs `gymnasium`

*If you're happy continuing to work with `gym`, then skip this section!*

We're using a relatively old version of `gym` (0.23.1), rather than the more recent (and maintained `gymnasium`). This is because RL libraries are notoriously buggy and susceptible to breaking changes, and we're working with a version which we know is compatible with the material. Annoyingly this version of gym is only compatible with `wandb==0.13.10` rather than the more recent `0.16` versions, which is why we've fixed that version in the requirements file.

If you want to transition to `gymnasium`, it is possible (most of the material has been tested with gymnasium as well), but we chose not to make the transition because it wasn't worth all the breaking changes. A few bits of guidance if you want to use `gymanasium`:

- We recommend pinning version `gymnasium==0.29.0`.
- You should replace `import gym.(x)` with `import gymnasiumn.(x)`, and replace `import gym` with `import gymnasium as gym`.
- The most important change is that `env.step` no longer returns 4 objects, it returns 5: `done` is split into `terminated` and `truncated`.
	- `terminated` tells you whether the episode has ended because of environment-specific reasons (e.g. the cartpole has fallen over), and `truncated` tells you whether the episode has ended because the maximum number of steps has been reached. The relationship is `done = terminated or truncated`.
	- You can deal with this by simply defining `done = terminated or truncated` everywhere (or the `|` operator if you're dealing with arrays), and use `done` in the same way as before. However, you could also try and use `terminated` rather than `truncated` when appropriate. Using `done` will only incentivize the agent to maximize its reward within the episode length (e.g. it could always fall over at the 499th step in CartPole-v0 and this would still be fine), but using `terminated` will have different behavioural effects. Can you see why this is?
	- In day 1 material, you'll need to return a 5-tuple rather than a 4-tuple. Often this will just involve inserting `truncated=False` into the return tuple.
- `obs.reset()` now returns a 2-tuple of `obs, info` rather than just `obs`.
- The `infos` object is structured differently: it's a dict of lists, not a list of dicts.
	- You should replace `infos[environment]["episode"]` with `infos["final_info"][environment]["episode"]`, and `infos[environment]["terminal_observation"]` with `infos["final_observation"][environment]`.
- Remove `self.seed()` in the probes.
- Pass `render_mode="rgb_array"` into `gym.make` in the `make_envs` utils function.
- Comment out the `test_agent` function.
- When using atari, you'll want to use the gymnsasium library's built-in wrappers (found [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/wrappers/misc_wrappers/)), not the stuff in `atari_wrappers.py`.
