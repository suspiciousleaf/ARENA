# Q-Learning

> ### Learning objectives
>
> - Understand the basic Q-learning algorithm
> - Implement SARSA and Q-Learning, and compare them on different envionments
> - Understand the difference between model-based and model-free algorithms
> - Learn more about exploration vs exploitation, and create an epsilon-greedy policy based on your Q-values

Now, we deal with situations where the environment is a black-box, and the agent must learn the rules of the world via interaction with it. This is different from everything else we've done so far, e.g. in the previous section we could calculate optimal policies by using the tensors $R$ and $T$, which we will now assume the agent doesn't have direct knowledge of.

We call algorithms which have access to the transition probability distribution and reward function **model-based algorithms**. **Q-learning** is a **model-free algorithm**. From the original paper introducing Q-learning:

> *[Q-learning] provides agents with the capability of learning to act optimally in Markovian domains by experiencing the consequences of actions, without requiring them to build maps of the domains.*

The "Q" part of Q-learning refers to the function $Q$ which we encountered yesterday - the expected rewards for an action $a$ taken in a particular state $s$, based on some policy $\pi$.

## Readings

Don't worry about absorbing every detail, we will repeat a lot of the details here. Don't worry too much about the maths, we will also cover that here.

- [Sutton and Barto](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf)
    - Chapter 6, Section 6.1, 6.3 (Especially Example 6.4)
    - Note that Section 6.1 talks about temporal difference (TD) updates for the value function $V$. We will instead be using TD updates for the Q-value $Q$.
    - Don't worry about the references to Monte Carlo in Chapter 5.

### Optional Readings

- [Q-Learning](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00992698.pdf) The original paper where Q-learning is first described.

Again, we'll be using NumPy for this section, and we'll start off with our gridworld environment from last week:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gridworld.png" width="300">

but this time we'll use it within the `gym` framework.

## Recap of `gym.Env`

Let's have a speed recap of the key features the `gym.Env` class provides, and see how we can use it to wrap our gridworld environment from last week.

### The `step` method

The environment's `step` method takes the action selected by the agent and returns four values: `obs`, `reward`, `done`, and the `info` dictionary.

`obs` and `reward` is the next observation and reward that the agent receives based on the action chosen.

`done` indicates if the environment has entered a terminal state and ended. Here, both the goal-states (+1 and -1) are terminal. Early termination is equivalent to an infinite trajectory where the agent remains trapped for all future states, and always receives reward zero.

`info` can contain anything extra that doesn't fit into the uniform interface - it's up to the environment what to put into it. A good use of this is for debugging information that the agent isn't "supposed" to see, like the dynamics of the environment. Agents that cheat and peek at `info` are helpful because we know that they should obtain the maximum possible rewards; if they aren't, then there's a bug. We will throw the entire underlying environment into `info`, from which an agent could cheat by peeking at the values for `T` and `R`.

### The `render` method

Render is only used for debugging or entertainment, and what it does is up to the environment. It might render a little popup window showing the Atari game, or it might give you a RGB image tensor, or just some ASCII text describing what's happening.

### Terminology note - observation vs. state

We use the word *observation* here as some environments are *partially observable*, the agent receives not an exact description of the state they are in, but merely an observation giving a partial description (for our gridworld, it could be a description of which cells directly adjacent to the agent are free to move into, rather than precisely which state they are in). This means that the agent would be unable to distinguish the cell north of the wall from the cell south of the wall. Returning the state as the observation is a special case, and we will often refer to one or the other as required.

### Observation and Action Types

A `gym.Env` is a generic type: both the type of the observations and the type of the actions depends on the specifics of the environment.

We're only dealing with the simplest case: a discrete set of actions which are the same in every state. In general, the actions could be continuous, or depend on the state.

Below, we define a class that allows us to use our old environment definition from yesterday, and wrap it in a `gym.Env` instance so we can learn from experience instead. This is very similar to our `MultiArmedBandit` class from last week, but more general.

Read the code below carefully and make sure you understand how the Gym environment API works.

```python
ObsType = int
ActType = int

class DiscreteEnviroGym(gym.Env):
    action_space: gym.spaces.Discrete
    observation_space: gym.spaces.Discrete
    '''
    A discrete environment class for reinforcement learning, compatible with OpenAI Gym.

    This class represents a discrete environment where actions and observations are discrete.
    It is designed to interface with a provided `Environment` object which defines the 
    underlying dynamics, states, and actions.

    Attributes:
        action_space (gym.spaces.Discrete): The space of possible actions.
        observation_space (gym.spaces.Discrete): The space of possible observations (states).
        env (Environment): The underlying environment with its own dynamics and properties.
    '''
    def __init__(self, env: Environment):
        super().__init__()
        self.env = env
        self.observation_space = gym.spaces.Discrete(env.num_states)
        self.action_space = gym.spaces.Discrete(env.num_actions)
        self.reset()

    def step(self, action: ActType) -> Tuple[ObsType, float, bool, dict]:
        '''
        Execute an action and return the new state, reward, done flag, and additional info.
        The behaviour of this function depends primarily on the dynamics of the underlying
        environment.
        '''
        (states, rewards, probs) = self.env.dynamics(self.pos, action)
        idx = self.np_random.choice(len(states), p=probs)
        (new_state, reward) = (states[idx], rewards[idx])
        self.pos = new_state
        done = self.pos in self.env.terminal
        return (new_state, reward, done, {"env": self.env})

    def reset(self, seed: Optional[int] = None, options=None) -> ObsType:
        '''
        Resets the environment to its initial state.
        '''
        super().reset(seed=seed)
        self.pos = self.env.start
        return self.pos

    def render(self, mode="human"):
        assert mode == "human", f"Mode {mode} not supported!"
```
We already discussed how to register an environment and use a time limit wrapper in yesterday's exercises. Use these dropdowns to remind yourself if you've forgotten.

<details>
<summary>Registering an Environment</summary>

User code normally won't use the constructor of an `Env` directly for two reasons:

- Usually, we want to wrap our `Env` in one or more wrapper classes.
- If we want to test our agent on a variety of environments, it's annoying to have to import all the `Env` classes directly.

The `register` function stores information about our `Env` in a registry so that a later call to `gym.make` can look it up using the `id` string that is passed in.

By convention, the `id` strings have a suffix with a version number. There can be multiple versions of the "same" environment with different parameters, and benchmarks should always report the version number for a fair comparison. For instance, `id="NorvigGrid-v0"` below.

</details>

<details>
<summary>TimeLimit Wrapper</summary>

As defined, our environment might take a very long time to terminate: A policy that actively avoids the terminal states and hides in the bottom-left corner would almost surely terminate through a long sequence of slippery moves, but this could take a long time. By setting `max_episode_steps` here, we cause our `env` to be wrapped in a `TimeLimit` wrapper class which terminates the episode after that number of steps.

Note that the time limit is also an essential part of the problem definition: if it were larger or shorter, there would be more or less time to explore, which means that different algorithms (or at least different hyperparameters) would then have improved performance. We would obviously want to choose a rather conservative value such that any reasonably strong policy would be able to reach a terminal state in time.

For our toy gridworld environment, we choose the (rather pessimistic) bound of 100 moves.

</details>

```python
gym.envs.registration.register(
    id="NorvigGrid-v0",
    entry_point=DiscreteEnviroGym,
    max_episode_steps=100,
    nondeterministic=True,
    kwargs={"env": Norvig(penalty=-0.04)},
)

gym.envs.registration.register(
    id="ToyGym-v0",
    entry_point=DiscreteEnviroGym,
    max_episode_steps=2,
    nondeterministic=False,
    kwargs={"env": Toy()}
)
```

## Agent class

Just like yesterday, we've provided you with a base `Agent` class. This is different from yesterday's class in the following main ways:

* The `run_episode` function is now a method of this class, not a separate function. The `train` method is equivalent to yesterday's `run_agent` function.
* We've introduced the following dataclasses:
    * `Experience`, to store the agent's experiences. The 5 values we store here are $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ using previously established notation (we'll see later on why it's necessary to store these 5 values). The `observe` method now takes a single experience as input.
    * `AgentConfig`, which allows us to more easily package up the arguments we use to initialize our agent.

We've also given you the `RandomAgent` subclass, which picks an action at random using the random number generator provided by gym. This is useful as a baseline to ensure the environment has no bugs. If your later agents are doing worse than random, you have a bug! $\,$

```python
@dataclass
class Experience:
    '''
    A class for storing one piece of experience during an episode run.
    '''
    obs: ObsType
    act: ActType
    reward: float
    new_obs: ObsType
    new_act: Optional[ActType] = None


@dataclass
class AgentConfig:
    '''Hyperparameters for agents'''
    epsilon: float = 0.1
    lr: float = 0.05
    optimism: float = 0

defaultConfig = AgentConfig()


class Agent:
    '''Base class for agents interacting with an environment (you do not need to add any implementation here)'''
    rng: np.random.Generator

    def __init__(self, env: DiscreteEnviroGym, config: AgentConfig = defaultConfig, gamma: float = 0.99, seed: int = 0):
        self.env = env
        self.reset(seed)
        self.config = config
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.num_actions = env.action_space.n
        self.num_states = env.observation_space.n
        self.name = type(self).__name__

    def get_action(self, obs: ObsType) -> ActType:
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def observe(self, exp: Experience) -> None:
        '''
        Agent observes experience, and updates model as appropriate.
        Implementation depends on type of agent.
        '''
        pass

    def reset(self, seed: int) -> None:
        self.rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)

    def run_episode(self, seed) -> List[int]:
        '''
        Simulates one episode of interaction, agent learns as appropriate
        Inputs:
            seed : Seed for the random number generator
        Outputs:
            The rewards obtained during the episode
        '''
        rewards = []
        obs = self.env.reset(seed=seed)
        self.reset(seed=seed)
        done = False
        while not done:
            act = self.get_action(obs)
            (new_obs, reward, done, info) = self.env.step(act)
            exp = Experience(obs, act, reward, new_obs)
            self.observe(exp)
            rewards.append(reward)
            obs = new_obs
        return rewards

    def train(self, n_runs=500):
        '''
        Run a batch of episodes, and return the total reward obtained per episode
        Inputs:
            n_runs : The number of episodes to simulate
        Outputs:
            The discounted sum of rewards obtained for each episode
        '''
        all_rewards = []
        for seed in trange(n_runs):
            rewards = self.run_episode(seed)
            all_rewards.append(utils.sum_rewards(rewards, self.gamma))
        return all_rewards


class Random(Agent):
    def get_action(self, obs: ObsType) -> ActType:
        return self.rng.integers(0, self.num_actions)
```

## Cheater Agent

Just like yesterday, you'll implement a cheating agent that peeks at the info and finds the optimal policy directly using your previous code. If your agent gets more than this in the long run, you have a bug!

### Exercise - implement `Cheater`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

Below, you should implement the cheater agent. Last time we only implemented cheater for the multi-armed bandit problem, but here we're implementing a more general version. Recall that at the end of yesterday's exercises we wrote the function `find_optimal_policy` to find the optimal policy for any environment and value of gamma. You should use this function to define the optimal policy on initialization, and then fill in the `get_action` method so that it always returns the corresponding optimal action.

Once you've done this, run the code below to check that your cheating agent outperforms the random agent. The cheating agent represents the best possible behavior, as it omnisciently always knows to play optimally.

On the environment `ToyGym-v0`, (assuming $\gamma = 0.99$) the cheating agent should always get reward $2 \gamma = 1.98$,
and the random agent should get a fluctuating reward, with average $\frac{2 \gamma + 1}{2} = 1.49$.

Hint: Use `env.unwrapped.env` to extract the `Environment` wrapped inside `gym.Env`, to get access to the underlying dynamics.

<details>
<summary>Help - I get 'AttributeError: 'DiscreteEnviroGym' object has no attribute 'num_states''.</summary>

This is probably because you're passing the `DiscreteEnviroGym` object to your `find_optimal_policy` function. In the following line of code:

```python
env_toy = gym.make("ToyGym-v0")
```

the object `env_toy` wraps around the `Toy` environment you used last week. As mentioned, you'll need to use `env.unwrapped.env` to access this environment, and its dynamics.

</details>

```python
class Cheater(Agent):
    def __init__(self, env: DiscreteEnviroGym, config: AgentConfig = defaultConfig, gamma=0.99, seed=0):
        super().__init__(env, config, gamma, seed)
        pass

    def get_action(self, obs):
        pass


env_toy = gym.make("ToyGym-v0")
agents_toy: List[Agent] = [Cheater(env_toy), Random(env_toy)]
returns_list = []
names_list = []
for agent in agents_toy:
    returns = agent.train(n_runs=100)
    returns_list.append(utils.cummean(returns))
    names_list.append(agent.name)

line(
    returns_list,

    labels={"x": "Episode", "y": "Avg. reward", "variable": "Agent"},
    template="simple_white", width=700, height=400,
)
```

<details>

        # SOLUTION
        self.pi_opt = find_optimal_policy(self.env.unwrapped.env, self.gamma)

    def get_action(self, obs):
        # SOLUTION
        return self.pi_opt[obs]
```

</details>

## SARSA: On-Policy TD Control

Now we wish to train an agent on the same gridworld environment as before, but this time it doesn't have access to the underlying dynamics (`T` and `R`). The rough idea here is to try and estimate the Q-value function directly from samples received from the environment. Recall that the optimal Q-value function satisfies

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q^*(s,a) &= \mathbb{E}_{\pi^*} \left[ \sum_{i=t+1}^\infty \gamma^{i-t}r_i  \mid s_t = s, a_t = a\right] \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{\pi^*} \left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s', a') \right] \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where
* $s'$ represents the next state after $s$,
* $a'$ the next action after $a$
* $r$ is the reward obtained from taking action $a$ in state $s$
* the expectation $\mathbb{E}_{\pi^*}$ is with respect to both the optimal policy $\pi^*$, as well as the stochasticity in the environment itself.

Intuitively, this last line of the formula says <i>"if our policy is optimal, then (current value if next action is $a$) = (reward from action $a$) + (reward for choosing the best possible action at the next step)"</i>.

This means that, for any particular episode $s_0, a_0, r_1, s_1, a_1, r_2, s_2, a_2, r_3,\ldots$ we have that *on average* that:

$$
Q^*(s_t, a_t) \approx r_{t+1} + \gamma  Q^*(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})
$$

where $a_{t+1} = \pi^*(s_{t+1}) = \text{argmax}_a Q^*(s_{t+1}, a)$. Since this approximation is only valid on the assumption that future decisions are made optimally, it will not hold for non-optimal policies.

Letting $Q$ denote our best current estimate of $Q^*$, the error $\delta_t := r_{t+1} + \gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t,a_t)$  in this "guess" is called the **TD error**, and tells us in which direction we should bump our estimate of $Q^*$.
Of course, this estimate might be wildly inaccurate (even for the same state-action pair!), due to the stochasticity of the environment, or poor estimates of $Q$. So, we update our estimate slightly in the direction of $\delta_t$, much like stochastic gradient descent does. The update rule for Q-learning (with learning rate $\eta > 0$) is

$$
Q(s_t,a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t,a_t) + \eta \left( r_{t+1} + \gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t,a_t) \right)
$$

This update depends on the information $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$, and so is called **SARSA** learning (recall these are the exact 5 values we store in our `Experience` dataclass). Note that SARSA learns *on-policy*, in that it only learns from data that was actually generated by the current policy $\pi$, derived from the current estimate of $Q$, $\pi(s) = \text{argmax}_a Q(s,a)$.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/sarsa.png" width="700">

Note - we can intuitively describe this update step as "changing your $Q$-function based on the action you *actually* took, in a way which makes it more consistent with the current policy". On its own this wouldn't get us to the optimal value $Q^*$, instead it'd just get us to the correct value of $Q^\pi$. This is why we have to combine it with some kind of **policy improvement**. We use an epsilon-greedy policy (see below).

## Q-Learning: Off-Policy TD Control

As mentioned at the end of the last section, what SARSA is essentially doing is estimating $Q^\pi$ by using the rewards gathered by following policy $\pi$. But we don't actually care about $Q^\pi$, what we care about is $Q^*$. $Q$-Learning provides a slight modification to SARSA, by modifying the TD-error $\delta_t$ to use the action that $\pi$ *should* have taken in state $s_t$ (namely $\text{argmax}_a Q(s_t,a)$) rather than the action $a_t = \pi(s_t)$ that was actually taken.

$$
Q(s_t,a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t,a_t) + \eta \left( r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t,a_t) \right)
$$

Intuitively, if the SARSA update is "changing your $Q$-function based on the action you *actually* took, in a way which makes it more consistent with the current policy", then this update is "changing your $Q$-function based on the best possible action you can take, in a way which makes it more consistent with the optimal policy".

Note that each Q-learning update depends on the information $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$. This means that $Q$-learning tries to estimate $Q^*$ directly, regardless of what policy $\pi$ generated the episode, and so Q-Learning learns *off-policy*.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/qlearn.png" width="700">

## Explore vs. Exploit

Lastly, methods to learn the Q-value often have trouble exploring. If a state-action pair $(s,a)$ with low Q-value $Q^*(s,a)$ just so happens to return a high reward by chance, the greedy policy with respect to $Q$ will often choose action $a$ in state $s$ instead of exploring potentially other good actions first. To remedy this, we use instead an $\epsilon$-greedy policy with respect to the current Q-value estimates: With probability $\epsilon$, a random action is chosen, and with probability $1-\epsilon$ the greedy action $\text{argmax}_a Q(s,a)$ is chosen. The exploration probability $\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter that for now we will set to a constant $\epsilon = 0.1$, but more sophisticated techniques include the use of a schedule to start exploring often early, and then decay exploration as times goes on.

We also have the choice of how the estimate $Q(s,a)$ is initialized. By choosing "optimistic" values (initial values that are much higher than what we expect $Q^*(s,a)$ to actually be), this will encourage the greedy policy to hop between different actions in each state when they discover they weren't as valuable as first thought.

### Exercise - Implement Q-learning and SARSA

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 20-30 minutes on these exercises.

They are difficult, so you should use the hints if you need.
```

You should fill in the classes `EpsilonGreedy`, `QLearning` and `SARSA` below.

#### `EpsilonGreedy`

This is simply a base class which keeps track of the current Q-value estimates, and selects an action based on an epsilon-greedy policy (i.e. with probability $\epsilon$ a random action is taken, and with policy $1-\epsilon$ the Q-maximizing action is taken, according to current Q-value estimates. We've already filled in the initialization for you (with optimism), all that's left is for you to implement epsilon-greedy action selection.

#### `QLearning`

You should fill in the `observe` method for the `QLearning` class, to update Q-values based on observations (according to the formula above).

#### `SARSA`

You should fill in the `observe` method for the `SARSA` class, to update Q-values based on observations (according to the formula above).

Note that we've given the SARSA agent a slightly different `run_episode` function. Can you see what's different about this, and why we've done this?

<details>
<summary>Answer - what's different?</summary>

We've reordered the `while` loop contents. Before, it looked like this:

```python
while not done:
    act = self.get_action(obs)
    (new_obs, reward, done, info) = self.env.step(act)
    exp = Experience(obs, act, reward, new_obs)
    self.observe(exp)
    rewards.append(reward)
    obs = new_obs
```

Now, it looks like this:

```python
while not done:
    (new_obs, reward, done, info) = self.env.step(act)
    new_act = self.get_action(new_obs)
    exp = Experience(obs, act, reward, new_obs, new_act)
    self.observe(exp)
    rewards.append(reward)
    obs = new_obs
    act = new_act
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer - why is it different?</summary>

It's different in SARSA because the order of operations is different. We have:

- **SARSA** = take action $a_t$, observe $(r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$, then take action $a_{t+1}$, then update
- **Q-learning** = take action $a_t$, observe $(r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$, then update, then take action $a_{t+1}$

The key point being that *the action $a_{t+1}$ has to be computed before the SARSA update step, since SARSA updates on actions taken*. Whereas Q-learning updates should happen after the action $a_t$.

Don't worry if you don't fully understand this, the order of operations for these 2 algorithms can get a bit messy. All you really need to understand is this: in both cases, the code variables `exp.obs, exp.act, exp.reward, exp.new_obs` in the observe methods correspond to the pseudocode variables $S, A, R, S'$, and in the case of SARSA we also have `exp.new_action` which corresponds to $A'$.

#### Tips

- Use `self.rng.random()` to generate random numbers in the range $[0,1)$, and `self.rng.integers(0, n)` for random integers in the range $0, 1, \ldots, n-1$.
- The random agent results in very long episodes, which slows evaluation. You can remove them from the experiment once you've convinced yourself that your agents are doing something intelligent and outperforming a random agent.
- Leave $\gamma =0.99$ for now.


When you run the code below, you should expect to see SARSA outperform  Q-Learning (by a lot at first, then this gap will narrow). They should both be slightly worse than the cheater, and *much* better than the random agent.

Compare the performance of SARSA and Q-Learning on the gridworld environment v.s. the cheating agent and the random agent. Try to tune the hyperparameters to get the best performance you can.

- Which seems to work better? SARSA or Q-Learning?
- Does the optimism parameter seems to help?
- What's the best choice of exploration parameter $\epsilon$?
- The feedback from the environment is very noisy. At the moment, the code provided plots the cumulative average reward per episode. You might want to try plotting a sliding average instead, or an exponential weighted moving average (see `part2_dqn/utils.py`).

## Other Environments

`gym` provides a large set of environments with which to test agents against. We can see all available environments by running `gym.envs.registry.all()`

Have a look at [the gym library](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/) for descriptions of these environments. As written, our SARSA and Q-Learning agents will only work with environments that have both discrete observation and discrete action spaces.

We'll modify the above code to use environment `gym.make("CliffWalking-v0")` instead (see [this link](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/cliff_walking/)). We have the following graph from Sutton & Barto, Example 6.6, that displays the sum of reward obtained for each episode, as well as the policies obtained (SARSA takes the safer path, Q-Learning takes the optimal path). You may want to check out [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/walking-off-the-cliff-with-off-policy-reinforcement-learning-7fdbcdfe31ff).

Do you get a similar result when you run the code below?

Some notes:

* Use $\gamma = 1$ as described in Sutton & Barto, Example 6.6.
* Try tweaking the learning rate and epsilon (start with $\epsilon = 0.1$) to try and cause SARSA to take the cautious path, while Q-Learning takes the risky path.
* We've included some helper functions to display the value of each state, as well as the policy an agent would take, given the Q-value function.
* One of the bonus exercises we've suggested is to write your own version of `CliffWalking-v0` by writing a class similar to the `Norvig` class you have been working with. If you do this correctly, then you'll also be able to make a cheating agent.
* We've defined a `cliffwalk_imshow` helper function for you, which visualises your agent's path (and reward at each square).

<details>
<summary>Question - why do you think it's okay to use gamma=1 here?</summary>

The penalty term `-1` makes sure that the agent is continually penalised until it hits the terminal state. Unlike our `Norvig` environment, there is no wall to get stuck in perpetually, rather hitting the cliff will send you back to the start, so the agent must eventually reach the terminal state.

gamma = 1
seed = 0

config_cliff = AgentConfig(epsilon=0.1, lr = 0.1, optimism=0)

)
```

## Tabular Methods

The methods used here are called tabular methods, because they create a lookup table from `(state, action)` to the Q value. This is pure memorization, and if our reward function was sampled from the space of all functions, this is usually the best you can do because there's no structure that you can exploit to do better.

We can hope to do better on most "natural" reward functions that do have structure. For example in a game of poker, there is structure in both of the actions (betting £100 will have a similar reward to betting £99 or £101), and between states (having a pair of threes in your hand is similar to having a pair of twos or fours). We need to take advantage of this, otherwise there are just too many states and actions to have any hope of training an agent.

One idea is to use domain knowledge to hand-code a function that "buckets" states or actions into a smaller number of equivalence classes and use those as the states and actions in a smaller version of the problem (see Sutton and Barto, Section 9.5). This was one component in the RL agent [Libratus: The Superhuman AI for No-Limit Poker](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~noamb/papers/17-IJCAI-Libratus.pdf). The details are beyond the scope of today's material, but I found them fascinating.

If you don't have domain knowledge to leverage, or you care specifically about making your algorithm "general", you can follow the approach that we'll be using in the second half of today's exercises: make a neural network that takes in a state (technically, an observation) and outputs a value for each action. We then train the neural network using environmental interaction as training data.

## Bonus - build your own CliffWalking environment

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Importance: 🔵⚪⚪⚪⚪

You should spend up to 30-60 minutes on this exercise, if you choose to do it.
```

You should return to this exercise at the end if you want to. For now, you should progress to part 2️⃣.

You can modify the code used to define the `Norvig` class to define your own version of `CliffWalking-v0`. You can do this without guidance, or you can get some more guidance from the hint below.

Some notes for this task:

* The random agent will take a *very* long time to accidentally stumble into the goal state, and will slow down learning. You should probably neglect it.
* As soon as you hit the cliff, you should immediately move back to the start square, i.e. in pseudocode:
    ```python
    if new_state in cliff:
        new_state = start_state
        reward -= 100
    ```
    This means you'll never calculate Q from the cliff, so your Q-values will always be zero here.


<details>
<summary>Hints (for both methods)</summary>

The main way in which the `CliffWalking` environment differs from the `Norvig` gridworld is that the former has cliffs while the latter has walls. Cliffs and walls have different behaviour; you can see how the cliffs affect the agent by visiting the documentation page for `CliffWalking-v0`.

#### `__init__`

This mainly just involves changing the dimensions of the space, position of the start and terminal states, and parameters like `penalty`. Also, rather than walls, you'll need to define the position of the **cliffs** (which behave differently).

#### `dynamics`

You'll need to modify `dynamics` in the following two ways:

* Remove the slippage probability (although it would be interesting to experiment with this and see what effect it has!)
* Remove the "when you hit a wall, you get trapped forever" behaviour, and replace it with "when you hit a cliff, you get a reward of -100 and go back to the start state".

## Bonus - other suggestions

### Monte-Carlo Q-learning

Implement Monte-Carlo Q-learning (Chapter 5 Sutton and Barto) and $\text{TD}(\lambda)$ with eligibility traces (Chapter 7 Sutton and Barto).

### LR scheduler

Try using a schedule for the exploration rate $\epsilon$ (Large values early to encourage exploration, low values later once the agent has sufficient statistics to play optimally).

Would Q-Learning or SARSA be better off with a scheduled exploration rate?

The Sutton book mentions that if $\epsilon$ is gradually reduced, both methods asymptotically converge to the optimal policy. Is this what you find?

### Other environments

Try other environments like [Frozen Lake](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) and [BlackJack](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/blackjack/). Note that BlackJack uses `Tuple(Discrete(32), Discrete(11), Discrete(2))` as it's observation space, so you will have to write some glue code to convert this back and forth between an observation space of `Discrete(32 * 11 * 2)` to work with our agents as written.

### Double-Q learning

Read Sutton and Barto Section 6.7 Maximisation Bias and Double Learning. Implement Double-Q learning, and compare it's performance against SARSA and Q-Learning.
