# Learning Phase

> ### Learning objectives
>
> * Implement the total objective function (sum of three separate terms)
> * Understand the importance of each of these terms for the overall algorithm
> * Write a function to return an optimizer and learning rate scheduler for your model

In the last section, we wrote a lot of setup code (including handling most of how our rollout phase will work). Next, we'll turn to the learning phase.

In the next exercises, you'll write code to compute your total objective function. This is given by equation $(9)$ in the paper, and is the sum of three terms - we'll implement each one individually.

Note - the convention we've used in these exercises for signs is that **your function outputs should be the expressions in equation $(9)$**, in other words you will compute $L_t^{CLIP}(\theta)$, $c_1 L_t^{VF}(\theta)$ and $c_2 S[\pi_\theta](s_t)$. We will then perform **gradient ascent** by passing `maximize=True` into our optimizers. An equally valid solution would be to just return the negative of the objective function.

## Objective function

### Clipped Surrogate Objective ([detail #8](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=Clipped%20surrogate%20objective,-(ppo2/model)))

For each minibatch, calculate $L^{CLIP}$ from equation $(7)$ in the paper. This will allow us to improve the parameters of our actor.

Note - in the paper, don't confuse $r_{t}$ which is reward at time $t$ with $r_{t}(\theta)$, which is the probability ratio between the current policy (output of the actor) and the old policy (stored in `mb_logprobs`).

Pay attention to the normalization instructions in [detail #7](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=Normalization%20of%20Advantages) when implementing this loss function. They add a value of `eps = 1e-8` to the denominator to avoid division by zero, you should also do this.

You can use the `probs.log_prob` method to get the log probabilities that correspond to the actions in `mb_action`.

Note - if you're wondering why we're using a `Categorical` type rather than just using `log_prob` directly, it's because we'll be using them to sample actions later on in our `train_ppo` function. Also, categoricals have a useful method for returning the entropy of a distribution (which will be useful for the entropy term in the loss function).

Implement the function below. A few last things to note:

- Our `mb_action` has shape `(minibatch_size, *action_shape)`, but in most of the environments we're dealing with (CartPole, and later the Breakout Atari env) the action shape is an empty tuple, which is why we have the assert statement at the start of this function. 
- Don't forget to normalize advantages, and add epsilon to the denominator!
- The clip formula can be a bit finnicky (i.e. when you take signs and max/mins), we recommend breaking the computation onto a few separate lines rather than doing it all in one go!

```python
def calc_clipped_surrogate_objective(
    probs: Categorical,
    mb_action: Int[Tensor, "minibatch_size *action_shape"],
    mb_advantages: Float[Tensor, "minibatch_size"],

### Value Function Loss ([detail #9](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=Value%20Function%20Loss%20Clipping))

The value function loss lets us improve the parameters of our critic. Today we're going to implement the simple form: this is just the mean squared difference between the following two terms:

* The **critic's prediction**
    * This is $V_\theta(s_t)$ in the paper, and `values` in the diagram earlier (colored blue).
* The **observed returns**
    * This is $V_t^\text{targ}$ in the paper, and `returns` in the diagram earlier (colored yellow).
    * We defined it as `advantages + values`, where in this case `values` is the item stored in memory rather than the one computed by our network during the learning phase. We can interpret `returns` as a more accurate estimate of values, since the `advantages` term takes into account the rewards $r_{t+1}, r_{t+2}, ...$ which our agent actually accumulated.

The PPO paper did a more complicated thing with clipping, but we're going to deviate from the paper and NOT clip, since [detail #9](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=Value%20Function%20Loss%20Clipping) gives evidence that it isn't beneficial. $\,$

### Entropy Bonus ([detail #10](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=Overall%20Loss%20and%20Entropy%20Bonus))

The entropy bonus term is intended to incentivize exploration by increasing the entropy of the actions distribution. For a discrete probability distribution $p$, the entropy $H$ is defined as
$$
H(p) = \sum_x p(x) \ln \frac{1}{p(x)}
$$
If $p(x) = 0$, then we define $0 \ln \frac{1}{0} := 0$ (by taking the limit as $p(x) \to 0$).
You should understand what entropy of a discrete distribution means, but you don't have to implement it yourself: `probs.entropy` computes it using the above formula but in a numerically stable way, and in
a way that handles the case where $p(x) = 0$.

Question: in CartPole, what are the minimum and maximum values that entropy can take? What behaviors correspond to each of these cases?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The minimum entropy is zero, under the policy "always move left" or "always move right".

The maximum entropy is $\ln(2) \approx 0.693$ under the uniform random policy over the 2 actions.
</details>

Separately from its role in the loss function, the entropy of our action distribution is a useful diagnostic to have: if the entropy of agent's actions is near the maximum, it's playing nearly randomly which means it isn't learning anything (assuming the optimal policy isn't random). If it is near the minimum especially early in training, then the agent might not be exploring enough.

## Adam Optimizer & Scheduler (details [#3](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=The%20Adam%20Optimizer%E2%80%99s%20Epsilon%20Parameter) & [#4](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=Adam%20Learning%20Rate%20Annealing))

Even though Adam is already an adaptive learning rate optimizer, empirically it's still beneficial to decay the learning rate.

### Exercise - implement `PPOScheduler`

```c

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

Implement a linear decay from `initial_lr` to `end_lr` over `total_training_steps` steps. Also, make sure you read details details [#3](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=The%20Adam%20Optimizer%E2%80%99s%20Epsilon%20Parameter) and [#4](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=Adam%20Learning%20Rate%20Annealing) so you don't miss any of the Adam implementational details.

Note, the training terminates after `num_updates`, so you don't need to worry about what the learning rate will be after this point.

```python
class PPOScheduler:
    def __init__(self, optimizer: Optimizer, initial_lr: float, end_lr: float, total_training_steps: int):
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.initial_lr = initial_lr
        self.end_lr = end_lr
        self.total_training_steps = total_training_steps
        self.n_step_calls = 0

    def step(self):
        '''Implement linear learning rate decay so that after total_training_steps calls to step, the learning rate is end_lr.

        Do this by directly editing the learning rates inside each param group (i.e. `param_group["lr"] = ...`), for each param
        group in `self.optimizer.param_groups`.
        '''
        pass


def make_optimizer(agent: PPOAgent, total_training_steps: int, initial_lr: float, end_lr: float) -> tuple[optim.Adam, PPOScheduler]:
    '''Return an appropriately configured Adam with its attached scheduler.'''
    optimizer = optim.Adam(agent.parameters(), lr=initial_lr, eps=1e-5, maximize=True)
    scheduler = PPOScheduler(optimizer, initial_lr, end_lr, total_training_steps)
    return (optimizer, scheduler)
