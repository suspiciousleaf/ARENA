# RLHF on transformer language models

## The "transformer environment"

We'll start by discussing how we apply the reinforcement learning framework of states/actions/rewards to the setting of autoregressive language modelling.

### States, actions and episodes

Our actor is an autoregressive language model. The actions $a_t$ are the tokens generated by the model (i.e. the action space is the model's vocabulary). The states $s_t$ are **the entire sequence up to that point** (not just the most recent token). In other words, given a state $s_t$ (sequence) and action $a_t$ (token generation), our new state is the concatenation which we'll denote as $s_{t+1} = [s_t \; a_t]$.

Each episode is a fixed length (i.e. all our sampled outputs will have the same number of tokens generated from them). Each episode starts with an initial "prefix prompt", which is chosen before the start of training.

### Rewards and value functions

The reward $r_t$ is a function of the sequence $s_t$. Sometimes it will be a very simple function like the sum of periods `.` in the sequence, other times it'll get a bit more complicated (e.g. using a text classification model to estimate the sentiment of a sequence - we'll do this later!).

In our case, we'll only evaluate the reward at the end of the episode. This means we don't really have a concept of discount factors here - the reward only comes once, and as soon as it comes our episode terminates.

The value function $V(s_t)$ is an estimate of the expected sum of future rewards (up to the end of the episode), which in this case means it's an estimate of what the reward will be once we get to the end of the sequence. We'll be adding a value head to our transformer model to estimate this value function (more on this later).

### ~~Generalized~~ Advantage Estimation

We won't be using the GAE formula today for computing advantages, we'll just be directly computing it via $A(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t)$, where $a_t$ is the value which was actually taken and $Q(s_t, a_t)$ is the critic's estimate of the value function at this new state $s_{t+1} = [s_t \; a_t]$.

We can get away with this because our setup has pretty low variance when it comes to the advantage of particular actions. GAE is most helpful when it reduces variance in the advantage estimation (it does this at the cost of introducing more bias from including future value function estimates), and so it's especially useful when our environment is one with high variability when the advantage (and optimal policy) changes significantly between steps. But this doesn't really apply to us, since every action just adds a single token onto our sequence.

## RLHF Setup

With this context in mind, we're now ready to look at the full RLHF setup we'll be using:

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkLOrrPWYAAiFLF.jpg:large" width="700">

Our autoregressive transformer model (we'll be using GPT2-Small) is the actor, and its value head will play the role of the critic. We follow the standard PPO setup:

- In **rollout phase**, the actor generates a bunch of sequences all starting from the prefix prompt. We compute advantage estimates using the critic network (value head) and store the experiences in memory.
- In **learning phase**, we sample from these generated experiences (i.e. from a bunch of generated sequences of different lengths, some of which might be prefixes of each other). We compute our loss function (which is the sum of the same 3 terms as yesterday) and perform a gradient step with respect to it.

The only new element is the **KL prediction shift penalty**. This is a penalty we add to our overall loss function to stop the transformer from diverging too much from its initial distribution. We want to make our transformer maximize reward, but not in a way which causes it to become completely incoherent!

Note that we compute $D_{KL}(\pi_{PPO} || \pi_{base})$, not the other way around. This is because we want to penalize our new model for generating outputs which would be extremely unlikely under the old model (recall that $D_{KL}(P || Q)$ blows up when some probability $Q_i$ is very small and $P_i$ is not small). For example, when we train our model to maximize the number periods it outputs, we want to observe behaviour like shorter sentences and use of initials, not crazy mode-collapse behaviour like only outputting periods! On the other hand, we don't really care about the other kind of failure mode: if our original model had a very small chance of generating offensive hate speech, we definitely don't want to penalize our new model for completely eradicating this behaviour!

## Value head

If you worked on the Atari exercises yesterday, then you'l be used to the idea of having shared architecture between our policy and value networks. Intuitively, this is because both networks need to learn some kind of high-level encoding of the important variables in the environment - they just do different things with this encoding.

This leads to the idea of a **value head**. A value head is basically just a simple classifier model which we stick to one of the policy network's internal activations. You can think of this as a kind of feature extraction. When it comes to transformer models, we usually attach our value head to **the value of the residual stream at the very last layer, after layernorm but before unembedding**. Recall the key idea of **residual stream as output accumulation** - by the very last layer, it contains the most context about the overall sequence.\*

\*Technically this might not always be true, since there is some evidence that components of a transformer erase information in order to write different information to the residual stream. However, in practice we usually find that the residual stream at the last layer is the most useful for downstream tasks.

How do we implement this? Before you read further down, try to think about how you might implement this yourself, i.e. how you could extend the functionality of your `HookedTransformer` model by adding a value head.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Our solution uses hook functions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer - what we'll be doing in these exercises.</summary>

One method would be to directly edit the model by replacing its modules with different ones. But this is a bit awkward, because we have to also change modules which are downstream of the value head to make sure that they're only taking the residual stream as input (not the value head's output), etc.

A different method, which is what we'll be using in these exercises, is to use **hook functions**. We can attach a hook function to the residual stream at the final layer, and have it apply our value head to the residual stream values & store the output externally. Then we can use `model.run_with_hooks` to get our logits like normal, and fetch our value estimate from the external storage object.

We're used to using hook functions during inference mode to perform causal interventions or compute statistical functions of our activations, but they can also be used during training mode to perform computations which are part of the autograd's computational graph.

</details>

Engineering-wise, we can get a GPTwithvaluehead class by wrapping around the `HookedRootModule` (like in reference page) but adding a value head.

### Exercise - implement `TransformerWithValueHead`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 15-25 minutes on this exercise.
```

Here is a diagram of your implementation.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/value-head-3-light.png" width="600">

First define `self.base_model` and `self.value_head` in your init step (reminder that you should use `HookedTransformer.from_pretrained` to load in a pretrained model). Then rewrite the `forward` method so that it outputs both the logits from a forward pass *and* the output of the value head.

The easiest and most direct way to get the output of the value head would be to **add a hook to the residual stream before the unembedding matrix, which computes the output of the value head and stores it externally (or as a class attribute).** You can review the material from section 1.2 if you don't remember how to use hooks, and you can refer to the diagram on the [reference page](https://arena3-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/Reference_Page) for how to get the correct hook name.

Why do we need to add the hook after the layernorm? The answer is that the residual stream can often [grow in magnitude over time](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8mizBCm3dyc432nK8/residual-stream-norms-grow-exponentially-over-the-forward). Our rewards will be normalized (see later exercise), and so we want to make sure the outputs of our value head (which are estimates of the reward) also start off normalized.

```python
class TransformerWithValueHead(nn.Module):
    '''
    Defines a GPT model with a value head (the latter taking the last hidden state as input,
    post-layernorm).

    The value head is a simple MLP with one hidden layer, and scalar output:

        Linear(d_model -> 4*d_model)
        ReLU
        Linear(4*d_model -> 1)

        pass



# Define a reference model (we'll use this during RLHF)
model = TransformerWithValueHead().to(device)

# Test your value head's architecture
assert isinstance(model.base_model, HookedTransformer), "Your model should have a HookedTransformer as its `base_model` attribute."
assert isinstance(model.value_head, nn.Sequential), "Your model should have a `value_head` attribute that is a `nn.Sequential`."
d_model = model.base_model.cfg.d_model
assert len(model.value_head) == 3, "Your value head should be a `nn.Sequential` with 3 layers."
assert sum(p.numel() for p in model.value_head.parameters()) == (d_model+1)*4*d_model + (4*d_model+1), "Your value head should have the correct number of parameters."

# Test your class's forward pass
input_ids = t.randint(0, 1000, (1, 10)).to(device)
logits, values = model(input_ids)
assert logits.shape == (*input_ids.shape, model.base_model.cfg.d_vocab), "Your model's logits should have shape (batch, seq, d_vocab)."
assert values.shape == input_ids.shape, "Your model's value head should give you an output for every token in your input. Did you forget to squeeze the out_features=1 dim?"

print("All tests for `TransformerWithValueHead` passed!")

## Sampling from a transformer

If you didn't go through the sampling exercises during the first day of last week, you might want to go back to them and work through the first few of them (this is not essential). Otherwise, here's a quick refresher:

- The simplest form of sampling is **greedy sampling**, where we autoregressively generate text by always choosing the most likely token at each step (i.e. argmaxing over logits), appending this to our sequence, and continuing.
- Most other forms of sampling are non-deterministic, i.e. they involve randomness. The most basic form of random sampling is choosing the next token according to the model's logit distribution.
- Other common refinements of this basic method are:
    - **Top-k sampling**, where we only consider the top-k most likely tokens at each step, and choose from these according to the model's logit distribution.
    - **Top-p sampling** (also called **nucleus sampling**), where we only consider the top-p most likely tokens at each step, and choose from these according to the model's logit distribution.

We've provided the model sampling code for you below, because there are a few non-obvious things to consider that are specific to our current situation. Make sure you completely understand this function before moving on to the next section.

We'll highlight a few things about this function:

- `.generate` is the standard method to autoregressively generate text. This works for TransformerLens slightly differently than for HuggingFace models (TransformerLens isn't primarily designed for text generation). In particular, it doesn't have features to efficiently generate multiple outputs for a single completion by using key-value caching. So rather than passing an argument into `generate` telling the model to generate `batch_size` outputs, we've instead just repeated `input_ids` multiple times across the batch dimension. This is a bit wasteful since we're repeating computation on the input sequence, but it's not a big problem because the input sequences we'll be using are usually very short.
    - As a bonus exercise later, we've suggested you write a version of the `generate` method which uses TransformerLens' key value caching (since TL does support caching behaviour, it just doesn't have features to use caching in `generate` to produce multiple sequences from a single completion).
- We've used `stop_at_eos = False`, to make sure that the model generates the full `gen_length` tokens rather than stopping early.

```python
@t.no_grad()
def get_samples(base_model: HookedTransformer, prompt: str, batch_size: int, gen_len: int, temperature: float):
    '''
    Generates samples from the model, which will be fed into the reward model and evaluated.

    Inputs:
        gpt: the transformer to generate samples from (note we use gpt, not the model wrapper, cause we don't need value head)
        prompt: the initial prompt fed into the model
        batch_size: the number of samples to generate
        gen_len: the length of the generated samples (i.e. the number of *new* tokens to generate)

    Returns:
        sample_ids: the token ids of the generated samples (including initial prompt)
        samples: the generated samples (including initial prompt)
    '''
    # Make sure we've passed in the base model (the bit we use for sampling)
    assert not isinstance(base_model, TransformerWithValueHead), "Please pass in the base model, not the model wrapper."

    # Convert our prompt into tokens
    input_ids = base_model.to_tokens(prompt, prepend_bos=False).squeeze(0)

    # Generate samples (we repeat the input ids which is a bit wasteful but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
    input_ids = einops.repeat(input_ids, "seq -> batch seq", batch=batch_size)

    # Generate samples
    output_ids = base_model.generate(
        input_ids,
        max_new_tokens = gen_len,
        stop_at_eos = False,
        temperature = temperature, # higher means more random completions
        verbose = False,
    )
    samples = base_model.to_string(output_ids)

    return output_ids.clone(), samples
```

Here's some example use of this function:

```python
sample_ids, samples = get_samples(
    model.base_model,
    prompt = "So long, and thanks for all the",
    batch_size = 5,
    gen_len = 20,
    temperature = 0.8,
)

table = Table("Token IDs", "Samples", title="Demo of `sample` function", show_lines=True)

for ids, sample in zip(sample_ids, samples):
    table.add_row(str(ids.tolist()), repr(sample))

rprint(table)
```

### Exercise - implement `reward_fn_char_count`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪

You should spend ~5 minutes on this exercise.
```

We'll start with a very basic reward function: counting the total number of periods in the sequence. For convenience, you should write your reward function to take in either a single sequence or a list of sequences (it will correspondingly return either a float or a tensor of floats).

An interesting thing to note about this reward function - it counts over all characters, but the episode length is defined in terms of tokens. This means that theoretically our model could reward hack by outputting tokens with more than one `.` character. This particular model's vocabulary happens to include the token `'.' * 64`, so rewards would be through the roof if this was ever generated! However, remember that RL is about performing actions, getting feedback on those actions, and using that feedback to influence your policy. The token `'.' * 64` is so unlikely to ever be generated that it'll probably never be positively reinforced, and we avoid this problem.

```python
def reward_fn_char_count(generated_sample: Union[str, List[str]], char: str = '.') -> Union[float, Float[Tensor, "batch"]]:
    '''
    Reward function, evaluated on the generated samples.

    In this case it's very simple: it just counts the number of instances of a particular character in
    the generated sample. It returns a tensor of rewards of dtype float the input is a list, or a single
    reward (float) if the input is a string.
    '''
    pass


# Test your reward function
A = 'This is a test.'
B = '......'
C = 'Whatever'
assert isinstance(reward_fn_char_count(A), float)
assert reward_fn_char_count(A) == 1
assert reward_fn_char_count(B) == 6
assert reward_fn_char_count(C) == 0
assert reward_fn_char_count([A, B, C]).dtype == t.float
assert reward_fn_char_count([A, B, C]).tolist() == [1.0, 6.0, 0.0]

print('All tests for `reward_fn_char_count` passed!')
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
def reward_fn_char_count(generated_sample: Union[str, List[str]], char: str = '.') -> Union[float, Float[Tensor, "batch"]]:
    '''
    Reward function, evaluated on the generated samples.

    In this case it's very simple: it just counts the number of instances of a particular character in
    the generated sample. It returns a tensor of rewards of dtype float the input is a list, or a single

    '''
    if isinstance(generated_sample, list):
        return t.tensor([reward_fn_char_count(item) for item in generated_sample]).float().to(device)
    else:
        return float(generated_sample.count(char))
```

</details>

### Exercise - brainstorm your reward function

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend ~5 minutes on this exercise.
```

Take 5 minutes (on your own or with a partner) to brainstorm how the model might be able to maximize the output of periods in ways which don't produce incoherent output (e.g. collapsing into only outputting periods). Remember we have a KL penalty with the reference model, meaning the model is penalized for producing outputs which would be very unlikely under the original model. What ideas can you come up with? When you train your model and observe the output, you should come back here and see how many of the period-maximizing behaviours you predicted actually occur.

This exercise is a great way to start thinking about the effects of different reward functions - although it's only a toy example, it still illustrates the important alignment concept that the behaviour induced by certain reward functions might not always be what you expect!

<details>
<summary>Spoiler - which behaviours will your model pick up?</summary>

The strategies adopted by the model very a lot depending on the prefix string, also thanks to mode collapse it will often find one of these behaviours and entirely ignore the others.

Some common strategies include:

- Shorter sentences
- Repeating `U.S.` or `U.S.A.` (using the prefix prompt `"There is"`, this seems to be by far the most common strategy)
- Library versions e.g. `Python 2.7.12` or `the 2.6.0.2 release`
- Names with initials e.g. `C. S. Lewis` or titles e.g. `Dr.` and `PhD.`
- Abbreviations e.g. `Data-R.A.R. series` or `"L.A. Times"`
- Decimals in numbers e.g. `9.5cm x 7.5 cm`
- Triple periods e.g. `the man . . . the woman . . .`

</details>

### Exercise - implement `normalize_reward`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪

You should spend ~5 minutes on this exercise.
```

Following advice from Ziegler el al. (2019), it's important to normalize the reward function over each batch (i.e. subtract mean and divide by std dev). We've been able to get away with not doing this so far because our reward functions were usually nicely bounded, e.g. the reward was always zero or one in cartpole (and even in our reward shaping it was still in the zero-one range). But if we're working with reward functions that could be much higher variance such as the number of periods in a generated sequence, then we should normalize.

Note - we're not super strict about this function; the denominator being `std + eps` or `(var + eps).sqrt()` are both fine.

```python
def normalize_reward(reward: Float[Tensor, "batch_size"], eps=1e-5) -> Float[Tensor, "batch_size"]:
    '''
    Normalizes the reward function values over the batch of sequences.
    '''
    pass


# Test your reward normalization function
reward = 10 + 5 * t.randn(10_000)
reward_normalized = normalize_reward(reward)
assert reward_normalized.mean().abs() < 1e-4
assert (reward_normalized.std() - 1).abs() < 1e-4
# Test edge case of zero reward
reward = t.zeros(5)
reward_normalized = normalize_reward(reward)
assert reward_normalized.abs().sum() < 1e-4

print('All tests for `normalize_reward` passed!')
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
def normalize_reward(reward: Float[Tensor, "batch_size"], eps=1e-5) -> Float[Tensor, "batch_size"]:
    '''
    Normalizes the reward function values over the batch of sequences.
    '''
    return (reward - reward.mean()) / (reward.std() + eps)
```

</details>

## RLHF training args

We've given you a bunch of training args to use for RLHF. Most of these are similar to the PPO args, although we'll go over the ones we've added / removed.

- We're now using `total_phases` to control how long our training lasts for, rather than using `total_timesteps`. This makes more sense for us, because the total number of timesteps (= number of actions we take = number of tokens we generate) will vary depending on the length of the sequences we generate.
- We've removed the arguments `gamma` and `gae_lambda` for computing the advantage function, since as discussed we'll be computing the advantage in a simpler and more direct way (you'll do this in the next exercise).
- We've added the following arguments related to the base model & text sampling:
    - `base_model`, for specifying different base models (default is `"gpt2-small"`)
    - `gen_len`, the length of the sequences we generate.
    - `temperature`, for controlling the sampling temperature of our sequences.
    - `prefix`, the string we use to generate all samples.
- As well as the following extra RLHF-specific arguments:
    - `kl_coef`, for controlling the strength of the KL prediction shift penalty.
    - `reward_fn`, for the reward function we use.
    - `normalize_reward`, for whether we normalize the reward (this won't always be necessary).

### Exercise - implement `get_advantages`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

As we discussed earlier, your advantage function doesn't need to use GAE like yesterday. Instead, we'll base our estimates on the simple formula:

$$
A(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t)
$$

In place of $Q(s_t, a_t)$ we'll use the **one-step Q estimates**, i.e. our value function estimates after taking action $a_t$ at step $s_t$, meaning we're at new state $s_{t+1} = [s_t \; a_t]$. This is just the same as $V(s_{t+1})$ for all values of $t$ except at the last sequence position, since we can replace this value estimate with the known reward $r_t$ for the whole sequence.

The baseline $V(s_t)$ terms will just be using our **zero-step value estimates**.

We want to compute the advantages for every action taken after the prefix prompt, i.e. our output will have shape `[minibatch_size, gen_length]` where `gen_length` is the number of generated tokens from above. Note - your values tensor will have shape `[minibatch_size, gen_length + prefix_len]`, since it contains the value estimates for the whole sequence (including the prefix prompt). Make sure you slice correctly when computing the advantages!

This diagram should help explain things:

## Memory

We've given you an implementation of the `ReplayMemory` and `ReplayMinibatch` classes.

Some notes on how `ReplayMinibatch` differs from the PPO implementation:

- We don't need to store `actions` any more, because the actions (tokens generated) are in contained within the sequences themselves.
- We don't need to store `dones` any more, because all our sequences last for exactly `gen_length` steps.
- We need to store `ref_logits`, which are used to compute the KL penalty with respect to our reference model.

Some notes on how `ReplayMemory` differs from the PPO implementation:

- We can afford to make it a lot simpler. We don't need to worry about sampling minibatches, and we also don't need to worry about having methods to add experiences one by one (we'll add them all at once).
- We've computed `returns` (i.e. advantages + values) for only the positions where we'll generate new sequences (because we only evaluated advantages at these sequence positions). Later functions will include some error checking to make sure your tensors are the right shape (although it's good to add this kind of error checking yourself too!).
- We still use roughly the same structure for creating minibatches: for each `batches_per_learning_phase`, we generate a set of `num_minibatches` minibatches, with each of these minibatches being disjoint but having union equal to the whole batch. This means that every sequence will be seen exactly `batches_per_learning_phase` times per learning phase, just like we had in PPO yesterday.

```python

## Objective function

### Exercise - implement `calc_kl_penalty`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

Now, you'll implement the KL penalty function. As discussed, the purpose of this function is to make sure your new model doesn't diverge too much from the old model. We'll be using the KL divergence between the old and new models' logit distributions.

The formula for KL divergence of two distributions $(P, Q)$ is $\sum_i P_i \log (P_i / Q_i)$. Recall that we want our new logits to be $P$ and reference logits to be $Q$ (because this penalizes our new model for generating outputs which would be very unlikely under the original reference model).

You should take the mean over batch and sequence position dims, since each token represents a separate observation and action.

There are a couple more important points to address, before implementing this function:

#### Prefix tokens vs generated tokens

**We only want to compute KL for the new tokens generated.** This means we want to look at the logits for the tokens at sequence positions `prefix_len-1:-1`, since these correspond to **predictions for tokens after the prefix, within the generated sequence**. There's no point penalizing the model for having a different probability distribution on the tokens prefix prompt, since this won't directly induce a behavioural change (our prefix prompt is always fixed). We only care about changing the model's behaviour on the actual tokens it generates.


#### Numerical stability

There can be a problem when dealing with extreme values, since operations like log / exp are numerically unstable and can give you NaN values. To avoid this, make sure your order of operations is correct. **You should always start with `log_softmax` to compute logprobs, then take `exp` to compute probabilities,** and avoid functions `log` and `softmax`. This is because `log_softmax` subtracts a constant from all the values to avoid any of them being extremely large when we calculate the necessary exponentials (recall that the softmax operation is translation invariant i.e. we can add the same value to all logits and the probs / logprobs are still the same). We can then take `exp` of the result to get probabilities because taking `exp` of negative values is numerically stable. On the other hand, taking `softmax` to get (possibly very small) probabilities and then `log` to get (possibly very extreme negative) logprobs is not numerically stable.

```python
def calc_kl_penalty(
    logits: Float[Tensor, "minibatch_size seq_len d_vocab"],
    ref_logits: Float[Tensor, "minibatch_size seq_len d_vocab"],
    kl_coef: float,
    prefix_len: int,

### Exercise - (re)implement `compute_entropy_bonus`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to ~10 minutes on this exercise.
```

Next, we'll implement the entropy bonus function again. Rather than working with `probs.entropy()` like yesterday, we'll need to compute entropy directly from the logits, and take the mean over batch and sequence position dimensions.

The formula for entropy of a distribution $P$ is $- \sum_i P_i \log P_i$.

As for the previous exercise, you'll need to slice the logits to only look at the new tokens generated. Also, you'll need to take the same numerical stability precautions.

```python
def calc_entropy_bonus(
    logits: Float[Tensor, "minibatch_size seq_len d_vocab"],
    ent_coef: float,
    prefix_len: int

```

</details>

### Other objective function terms

Since the other two terms in our objective function (value function loss and clipped surrogate objective) are pretty much identical to yesterday's, we've provided them for you (taken from yesterday's solutions code). 

Note that **these functions all only take input of shape `gen_len`** (because advantages and returns are created with shape `gen_len`). So we don't need to do any positional slicing in these functions, like for the last two. When it comes to using these loss functions.

```python
def calc_value_function_loss(

```

### Exercise - implement `get_logprobs`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```


You'll notice that the functions above take logprobs of shape `(minibatch_size, gen_len)`, i.e. the logprobs on correct tokens for all the tokens generated by the model. It'll be useful to implement the following function (which should be pretty familiar to you by now).

This function takes `logits` and the corresponding `tokens` which were used as input, and returns an array of logprobs for the correct next tokens. Note, we're only taking the logits which are predicting tokens **after the prefix**, hence we've given you a `prefix_len` argument for this function. The diagram below should help explain this. Note, you can assume `prefix_len` will always be at least 1.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/get-correct-logprobs-3-solid.png" width="520">

## Optimizer & Scheduler

### Exercise - implement `get_optimizer`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

We need to be a bit careful when defining our optimizer. It makes no sense to have the same learning rate for our original model as we do for our value head. The value head was randomly initialized and has no idea what it's doing, but our model is pretrained and so it already has weights which have been trained to effectively extract features from text.

The syntax for using parameter groups in an optimizer is as follows:

```python
parameter_groups = [
    {"params": [param1, param2, ...], "lr": lr1},
    {"params": [param3, param4, ...], "lr": lr2},
]
```

where `params` is a list (or iterable) of parameters, and `lr` is the learning rate for these parameters.

You should fill in the function `get_optimizer` below, so that the value head's parameters all have learning rate `args.head_learning_rate` and the base model's parameters all have learning rate `args.base_learning_rate`.

Remember that we're using `maximize=True` with our optimizer (since we're maximizing an objective function rather than minimizing a loss function).

```python
def get_optimizer(args: RLHFTrainingArgs, model: TransformerWithValueHead) -> t.optim.Optimizer:
    '''
    Returns an Adam optimizer for the model, with the correct learning rates for the base and head.
    '''
    pass



args = RLHFTrainingArgs()
optimizer = get_optimizer(args, model)

assert len(optimizer.param_groups) == 2, "Your optimizer should have two parameter groups."

for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
    assert param_group["maximize"] == True, "Should be maximize=True."
    if len(param_group["params"]) <= 4:
        assert param_group["lr"] == args.head_learning_rate, "LR for value head should be `args.head_learning_rate`."
    else:
        assert param_group["lr"] == args.base_learning_rate, "LR for base should be `args.base_learning_rate`."

total_params = sum(len(param_group["params"]) for param_group in optimizer.param_groups)
assert total_params == len(list(model.parameters())), "Your optimizer should have the same number of parameters as the model."

print("All tests for `get_optimizer` passed!")

### Scheduler

In PPO, we had you write a custom class for implementing learning rate scheduling. This was useful to help you engage with the nuts and bolts of changing learning rates in PyTorch. However, PyTorch does provide a handy class for implementing custom learning rate scheduling. The syntax looks like this:

```python
optimizer = t.optim.Adam(...)
scheduler = t.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR(optimizer, lr_lambda=lr_lambda)
```

where `lr_lambda` is a function which takes in an integer (the total number of times `scheduler.step()` has been called) and returns a float (which **gets multiplied by the base learning rate** to create the new learning rate). Note that there are also schedulers other than `LambdaLR` which have specific behaviour and so you wouldn't need to write custom functions for them - you can read about these midway down [this documentation page](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html).

We've given you the code you'll be using for returning a custom `lr_lambda` function with a **linear warmup then linear decay**. We've also provided code for you in the trainer class's init method below which creates your scheduler. All you need to do is make sure you're stepping it appropriately.

<details>
<summary>Aside - why we use warmup</summary>

Warmup is a common strategy early in training, to make sure we don't get excessive updates early on. It seems to work pretty well empirically. Some possible reasons for this are:

* It helps avoid large updates when the Adam moving averages of first and second moments are not yet well calibrated.
* Early on in training, the gradients might be very large (especially for the value function) because the model's prediction is nowhere near where it needs to be. So an LR warmup is more useful early on, to help avoid massive steps.

</details>

Note - yesterday we stepped our scheduler after every optimizer step. But it's more common practice in PyTorch to step the scheduler once every epoch. In this case, we'll be stepping it **at the end of each training phase**.

```python
def get_lr_scheduler(warmup_steps, total_steps, final_scale):
    '''
    Creates an LR scheduler that linearly warms up for `warmup_steps` steps,
    and then linearly decays to `final_scale` over the remaining steps.
    '''
    def lr_lambda(step):
        assert step <= total_steps, f"Step = {step} should be less than total_steps = {total_steps}."
        if step < warmup_steps:
            return step / warmup_steps
        else:
            return 1 - (1 - final_scale) * (step - warmup_steps) / (total_steps - warmup_steps)
    
    return lr_lambda


def get_optimizer_and_scheduler(args: RLHFTrainingArgs, model: TransformerWithValueHead):
    optimizer = get_optimizer(args, model)
    lr_lambda = get_lr_scheduler(args.warmup_steps, args.total_phases, args.final_scale)
    scheduler = t.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR(optimizer, lr_lambda=lr_lambda)
    return optimizer, scheduler
```

If we want to log the learning rate, then we can use `scheduler.get_last_lr()[0]`.

## Training your model

We're now ready to put everything together! We've provided you with the skeleton of a training loop which should be very similar to yesterday's.

### Exercise - complete `RLHFTrainer`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵

You should spend up to 40-60 minutes on this exercise.
```

The functions you need to fill in have docstrings which should help. A few bits of guidance:

- Make sure the shapes of objects you are passing into functions is correct - especially when it comes to slicing objects of shape `(batch_size, seq_len)` across the `seq_len` dimension to remove the prefix prompt (or not).
- For faster feedback loops, don't use `wandb` until you've stopped getting errors!
- For an easy test of whether your model is working, use the hyperparameter `kl_coef=0.0` and print your generated sequences; you should quickly see the model collapse into saying `"This is......"`.

#### Logging to wandb - recap

If you want to log text to Weights & Biases, there are 2 main ways:

1. Just print output, this is logged to weights & biases under the "Logs" section!
2. Log tables. This should usually be done just once at the end of training (because you can't log tables incrementally, only all at once). Here's some example code I used here for logging all my samples in a single table, as well as my hyperparameters (useful when creating a run report):

```python
wandb.log({
    "samples_table": wandb.Table(["sample"], self.samples),
    "config_params": wandb.Table(["param", "values"], [[k, v.__name__ if callable(v) else str(v)] for k, v in self.args.__dict__.items()])
})
```

This works when `self.samples` is a list of length-1 lists, each containing a single sample (i.e. one of the strings returned frmo the `get_samples` method).

```python

    model: TransformerWithValueHead

        pass


    def train(self) -> None:

Once you've implemented your trainer class, you can run the code below to train your model. You can also play around with the parameters - in particular, try a few different prefix strings. The behaviour of the model (e.g. which kinds of techniques it converges onto for period maximization) or whether it easily mode collapses into insanity can be highly dependent on the prefix string!

Some common strategies you should observe include:

- Shorter sentences
- Repeating `U.S.` or `U.S.A.` (using the prefix prompt `"There is"`, this seems to be by far the most common strategy)
- Library versions e.g. `Python 2.7.12` or `the 2.6.0.2 release`
- Names with initials e.g. `C. S. Lewis` or titles e.g. `Dr.` and `PhD.`
- Abbreviations e.g. `Data-R.A.R. series` or `"L.A. Times"`
- Decimals in numbers e.g. `9.5cm x 7.5 cm`
- Triple periods e.g. `the man . . . the woman . . .`

You might also observe increasingly incoherent mode collapse if you train for too long. Here are a few that I got:

- `This is really helpful. The U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S.`
- `This is the A.A.G.A.R.M.A.R.M.A.R.M.A.R.M`
- `This is my mother. . . me. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`

[Here's](https://api.wandb.ai/links/callum-mcdougall/es12ygmm) an example run, which was generated using the default parameters (i.e. the code below).

```python
args = RLHFTrainingArgs(use_wandb=True)
trainer = RLHFTrainer(args)
trainer.train()
```

Example params for gpt2-large (I think this would work a lot better with layer freezing but haven't tried it, see bonus exercises!).

```python
args = RLHFTrainingArgs(use_wandb=True, base_model="gpt2-large", num_minibatches=16, kl_coef=0.5)
trainer = RLHFTrainer(args)
trainer.train()
```

### Exercise - use a more complex reward function

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 30-50 minutes on this exercise.
```

We recommend you experiment with a few different reward functions, in particular some sentiment-based reward functions which are based on pretrained text classification models. For example, you might want to start with one of the following:

- [`lvwerra/distilbert-imdb`](https://huggingface.co/lvwerra/distilbert-imdb), which was trained to classify IMDB film reviews as positive or negative.
- [`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment), which is a model trained on tweets and finetuned for sentiment analysis (categories are positive, neutral and negative).
- [`distilbert-base-uncased-emotion`](bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion), which was finetuned on the [Emotion Dataset for Emotion Recognition Tasks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/emotion-dataset), i.e. it's trained to classify text according to emotional tone (classes are sadness, joy, love, anger, fear and surprise). 

Note that for some of these, you should be using a prompt string which is appropriate for the reward function you're fine-tuning on, e.g. `"This movie was really"` for the IMDB model. Similarly, you might also want to change other parameters e.g. generation length. You can find a list of other models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=text-classification).

The solutions contain the following:

- A reward function derived from the `lvwerra/distilbert-imdb` model (with demo of it working),
- A wandb run of GPT2-medium using this reward function (both in positive and negative sentiment directions).

We recommend you try to do something similar before you compare your answers to the solutions.

```python
# YOUR CODE HERE - define a reward function derived from a sentiment model (and sanity
# check it by printing out some outputs on some chosen sequences).

# YOUR CODE HERE - train your model on this reward function
```

    ("neg", "I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film."),
    ("neg", "This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes."),
    ("neg", "Really, I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie might be really good. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong!"),

sentiment = reward_fn_sentiment_imdb(samples).tolist()

A run in the positive sentiment direction (see wandb review [here](https://api.wandb.ai/links/callum-mcdougall/3a1bl3y4)): 

```python
args = RLHFTrainingArgs(
    reward_fn = get_reward_fn_sentiment_imdb("pos"),
    prefix = "I thought the Céline Sciamma film 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' was",
    total_phases = 150,
    use_wandb = True,
    gen_len = 50,
)
trainer = RLHFTrainer(args)
trainer.train()
```

And for the negative sentiment direction (wandb review [here](https://api.wandb.ai/links/callum-mcdougall/misa79ct)):

```python
args = RLHFTrainingArgs(
    reward_fn = get_reward_fn_sentiment_imdb("pos"),
    prefix = "I thought the Céline Sciamma film 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' was",
    total_phases = 150,
    use_wandb = True,
    gen_len = 50,
)
trainer = RLHFTrainer(args)
trainer.train()
```
