## Introduction

This section is designed to take you through a full implementation of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). Much of this follows on directly from the PPO implementation from yesterday, with only a few minor adjustments and new concepts. You'll (hopefully) be pleased to learn that we're disposing of OpenAI's gym environment for this final day of exercises, and instead going back to our week 1 roots with TransformerLens!

We'll start by discussing how the RL setting we've used for tasks like CartPole and Atari fits into the world of autoregressive transformer language models. We'll then go through standard parts of the PPO setup (e.g. objective function, memory buffer, rollout and learning phases) and show how to adapt them for our transformer. Finally, we'll put everything together into a `RLHFTrainer` class, and perform RLHF on our transformer!


## Content & Learning Objectives

#### 1️⃣ Multi-Armed Bandit

In Part 1 we'll study the multi-armed bandit problem, which is simple yet captures introduces many of the difficulties in RL. Many practical problems can be posed in terms of generalizations of the multi-armed bandit. For example, the Hyperband algorithm for hyperparameter optimization is based on the multi-armed bandit with an infinite number of arms.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> * Understand the anatomy of a `gym.Env`, so that you feel comfortable using them and writing your own
> * Practice RL in the tabular (lookup table) setting before adding the complications of neural networks
> * Understand the difficulty of optimal exploration
> * Understand that performance is extremely variable in RL, and how to measure performance

#### 2️⃣ Tabular RL & Policy Improvement

Next, we'll start to get into the weeds of some of the mathematical formulations of RL. Some important concepts to cover are **Markov processes**, the **value function** and the **Bellman equation**.

We'll then put this into practice on some basic gridworld environments.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> * Understand the tabular RL problem, for known environments.
> * Learn how to numerically evaluate a given policy (via an iterative update formula).
> * Understand the policy improvement theorem, and understand what circumstances can allow us to directly solve for the optimal policy.
