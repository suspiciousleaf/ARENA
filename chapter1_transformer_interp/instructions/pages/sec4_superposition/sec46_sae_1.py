# Sparse Autoencoders in Toy Models

We now move on to sparse autoencoders, a recent line of work that has been explored by Anthropic in their [recent paper](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html), and is currently one of the most interesting areas of research in mechanistic interpretability.

In the following set of exercises, you will:

- Build your own sparse autoencoder, writing its architecture & loss function,
- Train your SAE on the hidden activations of the `Model` class which you defined earlier (note the difference between this and the Anthropic paper's setup, since the latter trained SAEs on the MLP layer, whereas we're training it on a non-privileged basis),
- Extract the features from your SAE, and verify that these are the same as your model's learned features.

## Reading

You should read Anthropic's dictionary learning paper (linked above): the introduction and first section (problem setup) up to and including the "Sparse Autoencoder Setup" section. Make sure you can answer at least the following questions:

<details>
<summary>What is an autoencoder, and what is it trained to do?</summary>

Autoencoders are a type of neural network which learns efficient encodings / representations of unlabelled data. It is trained to compress the input in some way to a **latent representation**, then map it back into the original input space. It is trained by minimizing the reconstruction loss between the input and the reconstructed input.

The "encoding" part usually refers to the latent space being lower-dimensional than the input. However, that's not always the case, as we'll see with sparse autoencoders.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is the hidden dimension of our autoencoder larger than the number of activations, when we train an SAE on an MLP layer?</summary>

As mentioned in the previous dropdown, usually the latent vector is a compressed representation of the input because it's lower-dimensional. However, it can still be a compressed representation even if it's higher dimensional, if we enforce a sparsity constraint on the latent vector (which in some sense reduces its effective dimensionality).

As for why we do this specifically for our autoencoder use case, it's because we're trying to recover features from superposition, in cases where there are **more features than neurons**. We're hoping our autoencoder learns an **overcomplete feature basis**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why does the L1 penalty encourage sparsity? (This isn't specifically mentioned in this paper, but it's an important thing to understand.)</summary>

Unlike $L_2$ penalties, the $L_1$ penalty actually pushes values towards zero. This is a well-known result in statistics, best illustrated below:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/l1-viz.png" width="450">

See [this Google ML page](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/regularization-for-sparsity/l1-regularization) for more of an explanation (it also has a nice out-of-context animation!).

</details>

## Problem setup

Recall the formulation of our previous model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
h &= W x \\
x' &= \operatorname{ReLU}(W^T h + b)
\end{aligned}
$$

We're going to train our autoencoder to just take in the hidden state activations $h$, map them to a larger (overcomplete) hidden state $z$, then reconstruct the original hidden state $h$ from $z$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
z &= \operatorname{ReLU}(W_{enc}(h - b_{dec}) + b_{enc}) \\
h' &= W_{dec}z + b_{dec}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note the choice to have a different encoder and decoder weight matrix, rather than having them tied - we'll discuss this more later.

It's important not to get confused between the autoencoder and model's notation. Remember - the model takes in features $x$, maps them to **lower-dimensional** vectors $h$, and then reconstructs them as $x'$. The autoencoder takes in these hidden states $h$, maps them to a **higher-dimensional but sparse** vector $z$, and then reconstructs them as $h'$. Our hope is that the elements of $z$ correspond to the features of $x$.

Another note - the use of $b_{dec}$ here might seem weird, since we're subtracting it at the start then adding it back at the end. The way we're treating this term is as a **centralizing term for the hidden states**. It subtracts some learned mean vector from them so that $W_{enc}$ can act on centralized vectors, and then this term gets added back to the reconstructed hidden states at the end of the model.

### Notation

Sometimes each of the hidden activations of the autoencoder are called **neurons**, sometimes they are called **features**. Because we're training our autoencoder on a model without a privileged basis in this section, we can safely refer to them as neurons without potentially getting them confused with the model's hidden activations (when we move onto the next section, we'll be explicit about which one we mean when we say "neurons"). As for "features", we'll usually use **autoencoder features** to refer to the features learned by the autoencoder (which are not necessarily the same as the model's features), and **features** or **model features** to refer to the features of our model's data generation process, which we're trying to recover.

The notation we'll use in this section is as follows:

- `n_features` = number of features of your data generation process (this is the same as `n_features` from the last section).
- `n_hidden` = number of hidden dimensions of your model (this is the same as `n_hidden` from the last section).
- `n_input_ae` = number of input dimensions of your **autoencoder**. This is the same as `n_hidden` (because we feed our autoencoder batches of hidden-state activations from our model), but we've named it differently to avoid confusion with `n_hidden_ae`.
- `n_hidden_ae` = number of hidden dimensions / neurons / features of your **autoencoder**. We require `n_hidden_ae >= n_features` for our autoencoder to have a chance of reconstructing all the features. Usually we'll have `n_hidden_ae == n_features` in this section.

<details>
<summary>Question - in the formulas above (in the "Problem setup" section), what are the shapes of x, x', z, h, and h' ?</summary>

Ignoring batch and instance dimensions:

- `x` and `x'` are vectors of shape `(n_features,)`
- `z` is a vector of shape `(n_hidden_ae,)`, which will usually be equal to or larger than `n_features` (so that our autoencoder is overcomplete)
- `h` and `h'` are vectors of shape `(n_input_ae,)`, also equal to `(n_hidden,)`

Including batch and instance dimensions, all shapes `(d,)` above turn into `(batch_size, n_instances, d)`.

</details>

## AutoEncoder class

We've provided an `AutoEncoderConfig` class below. Its arguments are:

- `n_instances`, which means the same as it does in your `Model` class.
- `n_input_ae`, which is the size of input to your autoencoder (i.e. the same thing as `n_hidden` for your model, since your autoencoder takes the model's hidden states as input).
- `n_hidden_autoencoder`, which is the size of your **AutoEncoder's** hidden layer. It should be at least as large as your model's `n_features` value since we're trying to train our autoencoder to recover features in *its* hidden layer.
- `l1_coeff`, which is used in your loss function - more on this later.
- `tied_weights`, which is a boolean determining whether your encoder and decoder weights are tied - more on this later.
- `weight_normalize_eps` - whenever you normalize weights, you should add this quantity to the denominator (i.e. divide by `std_dev + weight_normalize_eps`) - more on this later.

We've also given you the `AutoEncoder` class below. Your job over the next 3 exercises will be to fill in the `__init__`, `normalize_and_return_W_dec`, and `forward` method. After this we'll provide the `optimize` method to you, and the final unfilled function `resample_neurons` will be filled in later.

```python

```

### Exercise - implement `__init__`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 5-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

You should implement the `__init__` method below. This should define the weights `b_enc`, `b_dec`, `W_enc` and `W_dec`. Use [xavier normal](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html#torch.nn.init.xavier_normal_) for weight initialization, and initialize the biases at zero. If you are using tied weights, you shouldn't define the decoder `W_dec`.

Also, make sure you use `self.to(device)` at the end, to move the model to the correct device (as defined by your global `device` variable).

#### A note on tied weights

In our `Model` implementations, we used a weight and its transpose. You might think it also makes sense to have the encoder and decoder weights be transposed copies of each other, since intuitively both the encoder and decoder weights for a particular feature are meant to represent that feature's "direction in the original model's hidden dimension".

The reason we might not want to tie weights is pretty subtle. The job of the encoder is in some sense to recover features from superposition, whereas the job of the decoder is just to represent that feature faithfully if present. The diagram below might help illustrate this concept. This is why, when we have untied weights, we generally consider `W_dec` to be the "true direction" of the feature.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/w-dec-explained.png" width="700">

In these exercises we'll generally use untied weights.

```python
def __init__(self: AutoEncoder, cfg: AutoEncoderConfig):
    '''
    Initializes the two weights and biases according to the type signature above.

    If self.cfg.tied_weights = True, then we only create W_enc, not W_dec.
    '''
    pass


AutoEncoder.__init__ = __init__

tests.test_autoencoder_init(AutoEncoder)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
def __init__(self: AutoEncoder, cfg: AutoEncoderConfig):
    super(AutoEncoder, self).__init__()
    self.cfg = cfg

    self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(nn.init.xavier_normal_(t.empty((cfg.n_instances, cfg.n_input_ae, cfg.n_hidden_ae))))
    if not(cfg.tied_weights):
        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(nn.init.xavier_normal_(t.empty((cfg.n_instances, cfg.n_hidden_ae, cfg.n_input_ae))))
    
    self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(t.zeros(cfg.n_instances, cfg.n_hidden_ae))
    self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(t.zeros(cfg.n_instances, cfg.n_input_ae))

    self.to(device)
```

</details>

### Exercise - implement `normalize_and_return_W_dec`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 5-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

The next function you implement should normalize and return the decoder weights.

If you're using tied weights, this should just return the normalized (and transposed) encoder weights. If you're using untied weights, this should modify the weights of `W_dec` inplace and return `W_dec`. Note - you can modify the weights via `W_dec.data[:] = new_values`.

```python
def normalize_and_return_W_dec(self) -> Float[Tensor, "n_instances n_hidden_ae n_input_ae"]:
    '''
    If self.cfg.tied_weights = True, we return the normalized & transposed encoder weights.
    If self.cfg.tied_weights = False, we normalize the decoder weights in-place, and return them.

    Normalization should be over the `n_input_ae` dimension, i.e. each feature should have a noramlized decoder weight.
    '''
    pass


AutoEncoder.normalize_and_return_W_dec = normalize_and_return_W_dec

tests.test_autoencoder_normalize_W_dec(AutoEncoder)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
def normalize_and_return_W_dec(self) -> Float[Tensor, "n_instances n_hidden_ae n_input_ae"]:
    '''
    If self.cfg.tied_weights = True, we return the normalized & transposed encoder weights.
    If self.cfg.tied_weights = False, we normalize the decoder weights in-place, and return them.

    Normalization should be over the `n_input_ae` dimension, i.e. each feature should have a noramlized decoder weight.
    '''
    if self.cfg.tied_weights:
        return self.W_enc.transpose(-1, -2) / (self.W_enc.transpose(-1, -2).norm(dim=1, keepdim=True) + self.cfg.weight_normalize_eps)
    else:
        self.W_dec.data = self.W_dec.data / (self.W_dec.data.norm(dim=2, keepdim=True) + self.cfg.weight_normalize_eps)
        return self.W_dec
```

</details>

### Exercise - implement `forward`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵

You should spend up to 20-40 minutes on this exercise.
```

### `forward`

You should calculate the autoencoder's hidden state activations as $z = \operatorname{ReLU}(W_{enc}(h - b_{dec}) + b_{enc})$, and then reconstruct the output as $h' = W_{dec}z + b_{dec}$.

This function should return the following 5 arguments, in order:

- `l1_loss`, which is the absolute values of post-ReLU activations $z$, **summed** over the hidden dimension `n_hidden_ae`. This should have shape `(batch_size, n_instances)`.
- `l2_loss`, which is the reconstruction loss between $h$ and $h'$ (i.e. the squared differences between elements of this vector, **averaged** over the dimensionality of the vectors `n_input_ae`). This should have shape `(batch_size, n_instances)`.
- `loss`, which is the sum of the $L_1$ and $L_2$ losses (i.e. a scalar).
    - Note, we should sum over the `n_instances` dimension (because each instance should be training at the same rate), but we should take the mean over the `batch_size` dimension.
    - Also, the `l1_loss` should be multiplied by the `config.l1_coeff` parameter before adding the two scalars together.
- `acts`, which are the hidden state activations $z$. This should have shape `(batch_size, n_instances, n_hidden_ae)`.
- `h_reconstructed`, which are the reconstructed inputs $h'$. This should have shape `(batch_size, n_instances, n_input_ae)`.

<details>
<summary>Question - why do you think we sum over the hidden dimension when computing <code>l1_loss</code>, but average over the hidden dimension for <code>l2_loss</code> ?</summary>

Suppose we took the average of $L_1$ loss over the `n_hidden_ae` dimension; we'll create a thought experiment to show why this would be bad.

Consider a single feature, in an autoencoder with a fixed `n_input_ae` but a variable number of features `n_hidden_ae`. Let $i$ be one of the features. If we double the number of features, then any change in feature $i$ will affect the $L_2$ loss by the same amount. But the $L_1$ loss would be affected by half that amount, since we're averaging the $L_1$ norm over all features. So the more features we have in our model, the less any given feature will be encouraged to be sparse. In the limit, feature sparsity basically won't matter at all; only reconstruction loss will matter.

On the other hand, if we sum $L_1$ loss over the `n_hidden_ae` dimension, then in this thought experiment, the effect of a change in any given feature is still the same for $L_1$ and $L_2$ loss, so we don't have this problem.

## Training your autoencoder

The `optimize` method is given to you. It's the same as it was from your previous model, but with a few notable differences:

- We're now training our autoencoder on the hidden state activations $h$ of our model, rather than from the original randomly generated features $x$. We don't generate data directly from the `Model.generate_batch` method, but rather we use this method to generate features $x$, then use those features to generate hidden state activations $h$ for our model, which we use as the input to our autoencoder.
- Our autoencoder loss is the sum of the $L_1$ and $L_2$ losses returned by the `forward` function.
- The `optimize` method logs some more interesting data, including the fraction of hidden state activations $h$ which are active, for each instance. It also returns these values as a tensor at the end.

You should skim through this function and make sure you understand most of what's going on (although don't pay too much attention to the logging of objects like color and title, these just help with the animations you'll be producing at the end!).

AutoEncoder.optimize = optimize
```

First, we train our model (which is the thing that will be used to produce the data our autoencoder gets trained on), and visually check that it's learned the pentagon superposition pattern which we're hoping for. To make sure this happens, we'll use a very small feature probability (and we'll have the same importance & feature probability across all features & instances, for simplicity).

```python
cfg = Config(
    n_instances = 8,
    n_features = 5,
    n_hidden = 2,
)
model = Model(
    cfg = cfg,
    device = device,
    feature_probability = 0.01,
)
model.optimize(steps=10_000)
```

Verify we get the pentagon pattern we expect, for all instances:

```python
plot_features_in_2d(
    model.W,
    title = f"Superposition: {cfg.n_features} features represented in 2D space",
)
```

Generate a random batch, and verify that the embeddings more or less line up with what we expect:

```python
batch = model.generate_batch(250)
hidden = einops.einsum(batch, model.W, "batch_size instances features, instances hidden features -> instances hidden batch_size")

plot_features_in_2d(
    hidden,
    title = "Hidden state representation of a random batch of data",
)
```

Next, we train our autoencoder. The `optimize` function is set up to return a dictionary `data_log` containing data which is useful for visualizing the training process. We'll use this to create an animation of the autoencoder training over time.

```python
ae_cfg = AutoEncoderConfig(
    n_instances = 8,
    n_input_ae = 2,
    n_hidden_ae = 5,
    l1_coeff = 0.5,
)
autoencoder = AutoEncoder(ae_cfg)

data_log = autoencoder.optimize(
    model = model,
    steps = 10_000,
    log_freq = 200,
)

# Note - this can take a while to run (~1min)
plot_features_in_2d(
    t.stack(data_log["W_enc"], dim=0),
    colors = data_log["colors"],
    title = data_log["titles"],
)
```

You can also run the same code from above, to check our data is being correctly reconstructed by the autoencoder. If you've done everything correctly, you should see something like:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/like_this_2.png" width="600">

In other words, the autoencoder is generally successful at discovering the model's features, and maybe somtimes it's even lucky enough to learn all 5, but most of the time it learns "dead features" which never activate. You can check this by graphing the feature probabilities over training, in the code below. You should find that there are 2 types of features: ones which converge to the expected feature probability of $0.01$, and ones which quickly converge to zero. These latter neurons are **dead neurons**, and they're an annoying problem when it comes to training sparse autoencoders.

```python
frac_active_line_plot(
    frac_active = t.stack(data_log["frac_active"], dim=0),
    feature_probability = 0.01,
    title = "Probability of autoencoder neurons being active during training",
    width = 1000,
)
```

## Neuron resampling

From Anthropic's paper:

> Second, we found that over the course of training some neurons cease to activate, even across a large number of datapoints. We found that “resampling” these dead neurons during training gave better results by allowing the model to represent more features for a given autoencoder hidden layer dimension. Our resampling procedure is detailed in [Neuron Resampling](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html#appendix-autoencoder-resampling), but in brief we periodically check for neurons which have not fired in a significant number of steps and reset the encoder weights on the dead neurons to match data points that the autoencoder does not currently represent well.

Your next task is to implement this neuron resampling.

### Exercise - implement `resample_neurons`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 20-30 minutes on this exercise.
```

The process Anthropic describes for resampling autoencoder neurons is pretty involved, so we'll start by implementing a simpler version of it. Specifically, we'll implement the following algorithm:

* Find the dead neurons for this instance (i.e. the `neuron` values s.t. `frac_active_in_window[:, instance, neuron]` are all zero).
* For each dead neuron `dead_feature_idx` in this instance, you should:
    * Generate a new random vector `v` of length `n_input_ae`, and normalize it to have unit length.
    * Set the decoder weights `W_dec[inst, dead_feature_idx, :]` to this new vector `v`.
    * Set the encoder weights `W_enc[inst, :, dead_feature_idx]` to this new vector `v`.
    * Set the encoder biases `W_enc[inst, dead_feature_idx]` to zero.

We also have the arguments `h` and `neuron_resample_scale`, but you won't have to use them until later exercises.

The test function we've given you will check that your function replaces / zeros the correct weights.

Note - you don't have to use the for loop structure here, we've included it as a suggestion to make the function easier to implement.

```python
@t.no_grad()
def resample_neurons(
    self: AutoEncoder,
    h: Float[Tensor, "batch_size n_instances n_input_ae"],

    neuron_resample_scale: float,
) -> None:
    '''

        - Set new values of W_dec and W_enc to be these normalized vectors, at each dead neuron
        - Set b_enc to be zero, at each dead neuron

### Exercise - implement `resample_neurons` (the deluxe version!)

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 20-40 minutes on this exercise.
```

This section can be considered optional if you've already implemented the simpler version of `resample_neurons` above. However, if you're interested in a version of it which hues close to [Anthropic's methodology](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html#appendix-autoencoder-resampling), then you might still be interested in this exercise.

The main difference we'll make is in how the resampled values are chosen. Rather than just drawing them randomly from a distribution and normalizing them, we'll be **sampling them with replacement from a set of input activations $h$, with sampling probabilities weighted by the squared $L_2$ loss of the autoencoder on each input**. Intuitively, this will make it more likely that our resampled neurons will represent feature directions that the autoencoder is currently doing a bad job of representing.

A bit more guidance on exactly how this resampling works:

- For each instance `inst`, you'll be sampling `n_dead` vectors (with replacement) from that instance's batch of data `h[:, inst]` (where `n_dead` is the number of dead neurons for that particular instance).
- The sample probabilities will be given by `l2_loss[:, inst].pow(2)`, i.e. the squared $L_2$ loss of the autoencoder on that instance's batch of data.
- Your new `W_dec` weights will be these sampled vectors, normalized.
- Rather than doing the same thing for `W_enc`, we'll follow Anthropic's methodology and use the same vector but a norm of $\alpha \beta$ rather than unit norm, where:
    - $\alpha$ is the mean norm of the encoder weights of alive neurons for that particular instance, or just 1.0 if there are no alive neurons.
    - $\beta$ is a hyperparameter which we've given to you as `neuron_resample_scale` (Anthropic uses 0.2 as a default).

A few tips / notes:

- Make sure to deal with "divide by zero" errors. It's not always as simple as "add a small number to the denominator to make sure we don't get an error" - think about what dividing by zero would mean in this instance, and what you should do instead. For example, if your $L_2$ loss is zero for a particular instance, then there's no need to resample anything!
- When resampling, we recommend using `torch.distributions.categorical.Categorical` to define a probability distribution, which can then be sampled from using the `sample` method. We've included an example of how to use this function below.
- This function should definitely be done by iteration over instances, because it's pretty messy to vectorize! We've given you the template for this. Remember that most tensors you're working with have an `n_instances` dimension - make sure you're indexing into them correctly.

Note - the tests here are not exhaustive, because there are many small ways this implementation can differ. However, the model performance is also quite robust to small differences in implementation. For example, if you just always use `1.0` rather than `W_enc_norm_alive_mean`, it'll probably still work fine. If you only reset `W_enc` and completely forget to deal with `W_dec`, it'll probably still work fine (this happened to a friend of mine, totally not something I initially forgot about when I first published these exercises). We encourage you to play around with a few different methods, and see what works well!

<details>
<summary>Example of using <code>Categorical</code>.</summary>

```python
from torch.distributions.categorical import Categorical

# Define a prob distn over (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) with probs proportional to (4, 3, 2, 1, 0)
values = t.arange(5).flip(0)
probs = values.float() / values.sum()
distribution = Categorical(probs = probs)

# Sample a single value from it
distribution.sample()

# Sample multiple values with replacement (values will mostly be in the lower end of the range)
distribution.sample((10,))
```

If `probs` is 1D with shape `(D,)`, then `sample((k,))` returns a scalar tensor of shape `(k,)` containing samples from the integer range `0 : D`, and `sample()` will return a single scalar tensor.

If `probs` is nD with shape `(*N, D)`, then `sample((k,))` returns a tensor of shape `(*N, k)` and `sample()` will return a tensor of shape `(*N,)` (we treat the first `N` dimensions of the `probs` tensor as batch dimensions).

Classic gotcha - make sure to always pass in tuples to the `sample` function, and not pass in an `int` by accident. `sample((k))` and `sample((k,))` are not the same thing!

</details>

Once you've implemented this resampling method and passed the tests, you can try training your SAE again. Can you see how the resampling process is helping the autoencoder to more efficiently learn under-represented features, relative to the previous version?

Now you've passed the tests, re-run training code:

```python
ae_cfg = AutoEncoderConfig(
    n_instances = 8,
    n_input_ae = 2,
    n_hidden_ae = 5,
    l1_coeff = 0.25,
)
autoencoder = AutoEncoder(ae_cfg)

data_log = autoencoder.optimize(
    model = model,
    steps = 20_000,
    neuron_resample_window = 2_500,
    dead_neuron_window = 400,
    neuron_resample_scale = 0.5,
    log_freq = 200,
)
```

This code plots the encoder and decoder weights separately, on different rows:

```python
# We'll be plotting encoder & decoder on the first & second rows
titles = [title + ", first row = encoder, second row = decoder" for title in data_log["titles"]]

# Stack encoder and decoder along the n_instances dimension
data = t.concat([
    t.stack(data_log["W_enc"], dim=0),
    t.stack(data_log["W_dec"], dim=0).transpose(-1, -2)
], dim=1)

plot_features_in_2d(
    data,
    colors = data_log["colors"],
    title = titles,
    colab = True,
    n_rows = 2,
)

frac_active_line_plot(
    frac_active = t.stack(data_log["frac_active"], dim=0),
    feature_probability = 0.01,
    y_max = 0.05,
    title = "Probability of autoencoder neurons being active during training",
    width = 1000,
)
```

## Additional exercises

### Exercise - overcomplete basis

```c
Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 5-10 minutes on this exercise.
```

Try training your autoencoder with an overcomplete basis: `n_hidden_ae` strictly larger than `n_features`.

- Does your model learn the features faster?
- How long does it take for all features to be learned by at least one of the autoencoder neurons, and how long before all neurons are either dead or representing exactly one feature?
- Can you devise a procedure which kills neurons which are highly correlated with other neurons, and thereby allows the model learn a 1-1 correspondence between neurons and features, which is learned faster than when we used `n_hidden_ae = n_features`?

### Exercise - tied weights

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

One possible approach you can take is to tie your embedding and unembedding weights together, i.e. have `W_dec = W_enc.T` (for any given instance). Try rewriting your code to remove `W_dec` and replace all instances of `W_dec` with the transposed version of `W_enc`. You'll also need to rewrite the `normalize_decoder` method so that it operates on the encoder rather than decoder.

How do your results change? Why do you think this is, and what do you think the justifications are for tying or not tying the weights?

<details>
<summary>Answer (what you should see, and why)</summary>

```python
@t.no_grad()
def normalize_decoder(self) -> None:
    '''
    Normalizes the decoder weights to have unit norm. If using tied weights, we assume W_enc is used for both.
    '''
    if self.cfg.tied_weights:
        self.W_enc.data = self.W_enc.data / self.W_enc.data.norm(dim=1, keepdim=True)
    else:
        self.W_dec.data = self.W_dec.data / self.W_dec.data.norm(dim=2, keepdim=True)
```

You should see that the model is able to learn the features more quickly, maybe without resampling any neurons at all.

This is because our toy model is a pretty special case, where all the features have the same importance, are independent, and are evenly spaced around the unit circle, meaning there's no real difference between the notion of encoding and decoding directions (they're both equal to the direction in `model.W`). But this might not always be the case. As an example, consider the case where 2 of our 5 features are highly correlated. We would still want the decoder directions to be the same, because the purpose of the decoder is to reconstruct the original features. But the encoder is **optimized to detect interfering features in superposition**, so it might want to learn a slightly different set of directions (e.g. if features are correlated, or they have different importances).

### Exercise - explore untied weights

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-25 minutes on this exercise.
```

In the previous exercises, our model has learned a uniform solution. That is, all represented features are equally spaced around the unit circle, in the 2D hidden dimension. This guarantees that the encoder and decoder weights will be the same (we can argue this by symmetry). But intuitively, we shouldn't expect this to happen all the time. For an idea of why, read [Neel's public comment document](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/187jfZSbhRjjQaazjYlThBsKp3Q0Pw3VdIHVST9H2dvw/mobilebasic) on the dictionary learning paper. TL;DR - the decoder just tries to minimize reconstruction loss so it should represent the features faithfully, but the encoder has the added job of disentangling features which might be in interference with each other.

Below is some code to create a model, and manually alter its weights so that two features have high correlation. What do you think will happen when you train an autoencoder on this model? What will happen to the encoder weights? How about the decoder weights?

(You can recycle the code from above, to visualize the encoder and decoder training process simultaneously.)
