# Introduction to `nnsight`

In this section, you'll learn the basics of how to use the nnsight library: running forward passes on your model, and saving the internal states. You'll also learn some basics of HuggingFace models which translate over into nnsight models (e.g. tokenization, and how to work with model output).

> ### Learning Objectives
>
> * Learn the basics of the `nnsight` library, and what it can be useful for
> * Use it to extract & visualise GPT-J-6B's internal activations

## Important syntax

Here, we'll discuss some important syntax for interacting with `nnsight` models. Since these models are extensions of HuggingFace models, some of this information (e.g. tokenization) applies to plain HuggingFace models as well as `nnsight` models, and some of it (e.g. forward passes) is specific to `nnsight`, i.e. it would work differently if you just had a standard HuggingFace model. Make sure to keep this distinction in mind, otherwise syntax can get confusing!

### Model config

Each model comes with a `model.config`, which contains lots of useful information about the model (e.g. number of heads and layers, size of hidden layers, etc.). You can access this with `model.config`. Run the code below to see this in action, and to define some useful variables for later.

```python
model = LanguageModel('EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b', device_map='auto')
tokenizer = model.tokenizer

N_HEADS = model.config.n_head
N_LAYERS = model.config.n_layer
D_MODEL = model.config.n_embd
D_HEAD = D_MODEL // N_HEADS

print(f"Number of heads: {N_HEADS}")
print(f"Number of layers: {N_LAYERS}")
print(f"Model dimension: {D_MODEL}")
print(f"Head dimension: {D_HEAD}\n")

print("Entire config: ", model.config)
```

### Tokenizers

A model comes with a tokenizer, accessable with `model.tokenizer` (just like TransformerLens). Unlike TransformerLens, we won't be using utility functions like `model.to_str_tokens`, instead we'll be using the tokenizer directly. Some important functions for today's exercises are:

* `tokenizer` (i.e. just calling it on some input)
    * This takes in a string (or list of strings) and returns the tokenized version.
    * It will return a dictionary, always containing `input_ids` (i.e. the actual tokens) but also other things which are specific to the transformer model (e.g. `attention_mask` - see dropdown).
    * Other useful arguments for this function:
        * `return_tensors` - if this is `"pt"`, you'll get results returned as PyTorch tensors, rather than lists (which is the default).
        * `padding` - if True (default is False), the tokenizer can accept sequences of variable length. The shorter sequences get padded at the beginning (see dropdown below for more).
* `tokenizer.decode`
    * This takes in tokens, and returns the decoded string.
    * If the input is an integer, it returns the corresponding string. If the input is a list / 1D array of integers, it returns all those strings concatenated (which can sometimes not be what you want).
* `tokenizer.batch_decode`
    * Equivalent to `tokenizer.decode`, but it doesn't concatenate.
    * If the input is a list / 1D integer array, it returns a list of strings. If the input is 2D, it will concatenate within each list.
* `tokenizer.tokenize`
    * Takes in a string, and returns a list of strings.

Run the code below to see some examples of these functions in action.

```python
# Calling tokenizer returns a dictionary, containing input ids & other data.
# If returned as a tensor, then by default it will have a batch dimension.
print(tokenizer("This must be Thursday", return_tensors="pt"))

# Decoding a list of integers, into a concatenated string.
print(tokenizer.decode([40, 1239, 714, 651, 262, 8181, 286, 48971, 12545, 13]))

# Using batch decode, on both 1D and 2D input.
print(tokenizer.batch_decode([4711, 2456, 481, 307, 6626, 510]))
print(tokenizer.batch_decode([[1212, 6827, 481, 307, 1978], [2396, 481, 428, 530]]))

# Split sentence into tokens (note we see the special Ä  character in place of prepended spaces).
print(tokenizer.tokenize("This sentence will be tokenized"))
```

<details>
<summary>Note on <code>attention_mask</code> (optional)</summary>

`attention_mask`, which is a series of 1s and 0s. We mask attention at all 0-positions (i.e. we don't allow these tokens to be attended to). This is useful when you have to do padding. For example:

```python
model.tokenizer(["Hello world", "Hello"], return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
```

will return:

```
{
    'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1], [0, 1]]),
    'input_ids': tensor([[15496,   995], [50256, 15496]])
}
```

We can see how the shorter sequence has been padded at the beginning, and attention to this token will be masked.

</details>

### Model outputs

At a high level, there are 2 ways to run our model: using the `forward` method and the `generate` method. We'll focus on `forward` for now, and we'll discuss `generate` when it comes to multi-token generation later.

The default behaviour of `forward` in normal HuggingFace models is to return an object containing logits (and optionally a bunch of other things). The default behaviour of `forward` in `nnsight` is to not return anything, because anything that we choose to return is explicitly returned inside the context manager.

Below is the simplest example of code to run the model (and also access the internal states of the model). Run it and look at the output, then read the explanation below.


```python
REMOTE = True # You should change this if the nnsight library is suffering from server issues.

prompt = 'The Eiffel Tower is in the city of'

with model.forward(remote=REMOTE) as runner:
    with runner.invoke(prompt) as invoker:

        # Save the model's hidden states
        hidden_states = model.transformer.h[-1].output[0].save()

        # Save the model's logit output
        logits = model.lm_head.output[0, -1].save()

# Get the model's logit output, and it's next token prediction
print(f"\nlogits.shape = {logits.value.shape} = (vocab_size,)")

predicted_token_id = logits.value.argmax().item()
print(f"Predicted token ID = {predicted_token_id}")
print(f"Predicted token = {tokenizer.decode(predicted_token_id)!r}")

# Print the shape of the model's residual stream
print(f"\nresid.shape = {hidden_states.value.shape} = (batch_size, seq_len, d_model)")
```

Lets go over this piece by piece.

**First, we create a context block** by calling `.forward(...)` on the model object. This denotes that we wish to generate tokens given some prompts.

```python
with model.forward(remote=REMOTE) as runner:
```

By default, running this will cause your model to be loaded & run locally, but by passing `remote=True`, it causes the model to be run on the server instead. This is very useful when working with models too large to fit on your machine (or even models which can fit on your machine, but run slowly due to their size).

Calling `.forward(...)` does not actually initialize or run the model. Only after the `with ... as runner:` block is exited is the model actually loaded and run. All operations in the block are "proxies" which essentially creates a graph of operations we wish to carry out later.

**Within the runner context,** we create invocation contexts to specify the actual prompts we want to run.

```python
with runner.invoke(prompt) as invoker:
```

**Within an invoke context**, all operations/interventions will be applied to the processing of the prompt. Models can be run on a variety of input formats: strings, lists of tokens, tensors of tokens, etc.

This is all we actually need to run a forward pass on the model. We could replace the `hidden_states` line with just `pass`, and we'd still be able to access the model output in the same way. But the most interesting part of `nnsight` is the ability to access the model's internal states (like you might already have done with TransformerLens). Let's see how this works!

```python
hidden_states = model.transformer.h[-1].output[0].save()
```

On this line we're saying: access the last layer of the transformer `model.transformer.h[-1]`, access this layer's output `.output` (which is a tuple of tensors), index the first tensor in this tuple `.output[0]`, and save it `.save()`.

Let's break down this line in a bit more detail:

* `model.transformer.h[-1]` is a way of indexing an appropriate module in the transformer. If you `print(model)`, you'll see that it consists of `transformer` and `lm_head` (for "language modelling head"). The `transformer` module is made up of embeddings & dropout, a series of layers (called `.h`, for "hidden states"), and a final layernorm. So indexing `.h[-1]` gives you the final layer.
    * Note - it's often useful to visit the documentation page for whatever model you're working on, e.g. you can find GPT-J [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v4.11.3/_modules/transformers/models/gptj/modeling_gptj.html). Not all models will have a nice uniform standardized architecture like you might be used to in TransformerLens!
* `.output[0]` gives you this module's output, as a **proxy**.
    * The output of a module is often a tuple (again, you can see on the [documentation page](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v4.11.3/_modules/transformers/models/gptj/modeling_gptj.html) what the output of each module is). In this case, it's a tuple of 2 tensors, the first of which is the actual layer output (the thing we want).
    * When debugging, you can call `.shape` on a proxy. This will even work if the proxy represents a tuple of tensors; you'll get a tuple of all the sizes of these tensors.
    * Doing operations on a proxy still returns a proxy - this is why we can index into the `output` proxy tuple and get a proxy tensor!
    * You can also use `.input` to access the inputs to a module - this works in the same way (often also stored as a tuple).
* `.save()` takes this proxy output, and returns the actual object.
    * To be more specific, this informs the computation graph to clone the value of a proxy, allowing us to access the value of a proxy after the forward pass.
    * During processing of the intervention computational graph we are building, when the value of a proxy is no longer ever needed, its value is dereferenced and destroyed. If you've saved it, then you'll be able to access the value of the proxy after this happens (i.e. outside the context manager), using the `.value` attribute.

<details>
<summary>Optional exercise - we mentioned that <code>.output</code> returns a tuple of 2 tensors. Can you find what the second tensor in this tuple is?</summary>

The second output is also a tuple of tensors, of length 2. In the GPT-J source code, they are called `present`. They represent the keys and values which were calculated in this forward pass (as opposed to those that were calculated in an earlier forward pass, and cached by the model). Since we're only generating one new token, these are just the full keys and values.

</details>

The next command:

```python
logits = model.lm_head.output[0, -1].save()
```

works in a very similar way. If you look at the [documentation page](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v4.11.3/_modules/transformers/models/gptj/modeling_gptj.html), you'll see that `lm_head` is the linear layer mapping the final value of the residual stream to the final logits. The output is just a single tensor, not a tuple of tensors. Our indexing returns the vector of logits for the token after the last one on the sequence. 

If you've worked with TransformerLens (or even regular HF models) then you might be used to getting logits directly from the model output, but here we generally extract logits from the model internals just like any other activation because this allows us to **control exactly what we return.** If we return lots of very large tensors, this can take quite a while to download from the server (remember that `d_vocab` is often very large for transformers, i.e. around 50k). See the "which objects to save" section below for more discussion on this.

### Output vs input

You can also extract a module's input using `.input`, although the syntax is slightly different. Whereas `.output` gives you the same object as returned by the module's forward function, `.input` gives you a tuple of (tuple of args, dictionary of kwargs), with args and kwargs being the input arguments to the forward function. This usually means you'll need to use `.input[0][0]` to get a tensor input to a particular module. If you're not sure exactly what the `.input` object type will be, then you can debug by printing its shape (remember printing shape works for tuples containing `InterventionProxy` objects, it's not just something which works on objects corresponding to acual tensors!).

### Which objects to save

Note that we saved `logits` above, which is a vector of length 50k. In general, it's best to save as small an object as possible, because this reduces the size of object you'll have to download from the server. For example, if you only want the next token completions, just argmax the logits and then save the result! All basic tensor operations can be performed within your context manager.

## Putting this into practice


### Exercise - visualize attention heads

```c
Difficulty: ð´ð´âªâªâª
Importance: ðµðµðµâªâª

You should spend up to 10-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

We just covered a lot of content, so lets put it into practice. Your first task is to extract the attention patterns from the zeroth layer of the transformer, and visualize them using circuitsvis. As a reminder, the syntax for circuitsvis is:

```python
cv.attention.attention_patterns(
    tokens=tokens,
    attention=attention,
)
```

where `tokens` is a list of strings, and `attention` is a tensor of shape `(num_heads, num_tokens, num_tokens)`.

If you're stuck, [here's a link](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v4.11.3/_modules/transformers/models/gptj/modeling_gptj.html) to the source code for GPT-J. Look for how the attention patterns are calculated, within the `GPTJAttention` block.

*Note - this model uses dropout on the attention probabilities, as you'll probably notice from looking at the source code in the link above. This won't affect the model's behaviour because dropout is disabled in inference mode (and using the `generate` method always puts a model in inference mode). But it is still a layer which exists in the model, so you can access its input or output just like any other module.*

<details>
<summary>Aside - inference mode</summary>

Dropout is one of the two main layers whose behaviour changes in inference mode (the other is BatchNorm).

If you want to run the model without inference mode, you can wrap your code in `with model.forward(inference=False):`. However, you don't need to worry about this for the purposes of these exercises.

</details>

If you're stuck on how to reference the right module, see the following hint:

<details>
<summary>Hint - what module you should get attention from</summary>

You want to extract attention from `model.transformer.h[0].attn.attn_dropout.input`. If you used `.output`, it would give you the same values (although they might differ by a dummy batch dimension). Both of these will return a single tensor, because dropout layers take just one input and return just one output.

Remember, you need to use `.input[0]` to get the tuple of inputs, then `.input[0][0]` to get the tensor input.

</details>

```python
# YOUR CODE HERE - extract and visualize attention
```

<details>
<summary>Solution (and explanation)</summary>

```python
with model.forward(remote=REMOTE) as runner:
    with runner.invoke(prompt) as invoker:
        attn_patterns = model.transformer.h[0].attn.attn_dropout.input[0][0].save()

# Get string tokens (replacing special character for spaces)
str_tokens = model.tokenizer.tokenize(prompt)
str_tokens = [s.replace('Ä ', ' ') for s in str_tokens]

# Attention patterns (squeeze out the batch dimension)
attn_patterns_value = attn_patterns.value.squeeze(0)

print("Layer 0 Head Attention Patterns:")
display(cv.attention.attention_patterns(
    tokens=str_tokens,
    attention=attn_patterns_value,
))
```

Explanation:

* Within the context managers:
    * We access the attention patterns by taking the input to the `attn_dropout`.
        * From the GPT-J source code, we can see that the attention weights are calculated by standard torch functions (and an unnamed `nn.Softmax` module) from the key and query vectors, and are then passed through the dropout layer before being used to calculate the attention layer output. So by accessing the input to the dropdown layer, we get the attention weights before dropout is applied.
        * Because of the previously discussed point about dropout not working in inference mode, we could also use the output of `attn_dropout`, and get the same values.
    * We use the `.save()` method to save the attention patterns (as an object).
* Outside of the context managers:
    * We use the `tokenize` method to tokenize the prompt.
    * We use the `.value` to access the actual value of the intervention proxy `attn_patterns`.
        * This returns a tuple of length-1, so we index into it to get the actual tensor, then squeeze to remove the batch dimension.
        
</details>

As an optional bonus exercise, you can verify for yourself that these are the correct attention patterns, by calculating them from scratch using the key and query vectors. Using `model.transformer.h[0].attn.q_proj.output` will give you the query vectors, and `k_proj` for the key vectors. However, one thing to be wary of is that GPT-J uses **rotary embeddings**, which makes the computation of attention patterns from keys and queries a bit harder than it would otherwise be. See [here](https://blog.eleuther.ai/rotary-embeddings/) for an in-depth discussion of rotary embeddings, and [here](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=bef36Bf9k7FYsCt1DpzCw6eV) for some rough intuitions.
