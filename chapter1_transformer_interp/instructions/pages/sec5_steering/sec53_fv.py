# Function Vectors

In this section, we'll replicate the crux of the paper's results, by identifying a set of attention heads whose outputs have a large effect on the model's ICL performance, and showing we can patch with these vectors to induce task-solving behaviour on randomly shuffled prompts.

We'll also learn how to use `nnsight` for multi-token generation, and steer the model's behaviour. There exist exercises where you can try this out for different tasks, e.g. the Country-Capitals task, where you'll be able to steer the model to complete prompts like `"When you think of Netherlands, you usually think of"` by talking about Amsterdam.

(Note - this section structurally follows sections 2.2, 2.3 and some of section 3 from the function vectors paper).

> ### Learning Objectives
>
> * Define a metric to measure the causal effect of each attention head on the correct performance of the in-context learning task
> * Understand how to rearrange activations in a model during an `nnsight` forward pass, to extract activations corresponding to a particular attention head
> * Learn how to use `nnsight` for multi-token generation

Here, we'll move from thinking about residual stream states to thinking about the **output of specific attention heads.**

## Extracting & using FVs

### A note on `out_proj`

First, a bit of a technical complication. Most HuggingFace models don't have the nice attention head representations that TransformerLens models do. Rather than our `W_O` matrix which stored separate projections for each attention head and *then* summing over heads, we have the linear layer `out_proj` which implicitly combines the "projection per attention head" and the "sum over attention head" operations (if you can't see how this is possible, see the section "Attention Heads are Independent and Additive" from Anthropic's [Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html)).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/rearrange-output-2.png" width="950">

This presents some question for us, when it comes to causal interventions on attention heads. Use the dropdowns below to read them answer these questions (they'll be important for the coming exercises).

<br>

<details>
<summary>If we want to do a causal intervention on a particular head, should we intervene on <code>z</code> (the input of <code>out_proj</code>) or on <code>attn_output</code> (the output of <code>out_proj</code>) ?</summary>

We should intervene on `z`, because we can just rearrange the `z` tensor of shape `(batch, seq, d_model)` into `(batch, seq, n_heads, d_head)`, in other words separating out all the heads. On the other hand, we can't do this with the `attn_output` because it's *already* summed over heads and we can't separate them out.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How could we get the <code>attn_output</code> vector for a single head, if we had the ability to accss model weights within our context managers?</summary>

We can take a slice of the `z` tensor corresponding to a single attention head:

```python
z.reshape(batch, seq, n_heads, d_head)[:, :, head_idx]
```

and we can take a slice of the `out_proj` weight matrix corresponding to a single attention head (remember that PyTorch stores linear layers in the shape `(out_feats, in_feats)`):

```python
out_proj.weight.rearrange(d_model, n_heads, d_head)[:, head_idx]
```

then finally we can multiply these together.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How could we get the <code>attn_output</code> vector for a single head, if we </b>didn't have</b> the ability to accss model weights within our context managers? (This is currently the case for <code>nnsight</code>, since having access to the weights could allow users to change them!).</summary>

We can be a bit clever, and ablate certain heads in the `z` vector before passing it through the output projection:

```python
# ablate all heads except #2 (using a cloned activation)
heads_to_ablate = [0, 1, 3, 4, ...]
z_ablated = z.reshape(batch, seq, n_heads, d_head).clone()
z_ablated[:, :, heads_to_ablate] = 0

# save the output
attn_head_output = out_proj(z_ablated).save()
```

Illustration:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/rearrange-output-ablated-2.png" width="950">

Note - this would actually fail if `out_proj` had a bias, because we want to just get an attention head's output, not the bias term as well. But if you look at the [documentation page](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v4.11.3/_modules/transformers/models/gptj/modeling_gptj.html) you'll see that `out_proj` doesn't have a bias term, so we're all good!

</details>

### Exercise - implement `calculate_fn_vectors_and_intervene`

```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µ

You should spend up to 30-60 minutes on this exercise.
```

This is probably the most important function in today's exercises. Implementing it will be pretty similar to the previous function `calculate_h_and_intervene`, but:

* Rather than extracting the value of the residual stream `h` at some particular layer, you'll be extracting the output of the attention heads: iterating over each layer and each head in the model.
    * You'll only need to run one clean forward pass to compute all these values, but you'll need to run a separate corrupted forward pass for each head.
* Rather than your 2 different datasets being (dataset, zero-shot dataset), your two datasets will be (dataset, corrupted version of that same dataset).
    * You can use the method `create_corrupted_dataset` method of the `ICLDataset` class for this.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/cie-intervention.png" width="1200">

Before you actually start writing the code, it might be helpful to answer the following:

<details>
<summary>How many different <code>invoker</code> objects will you need in total?</summary>

You'll need `(N_LAYERS * N_HEADS) + 2`. To explain:

- One for the clean prompts, which you'll extract internal activations from and patch them into corrupted prompts,
- One for the corrupted prompts, which you don't intervene on,
- One for the corrupted prompts **for every attention head**, which you'll patch into using the clean run activations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which proxy outputs (if any) will you need to use <code>.save()</code> on, in this function?</summary>

You don't need to `.save()` the function vectors you're extracting from the model's internals, because these will only be used for causal interventions within the context manager.

The only thing you need to save is the correct token logprobs for (1) the corrupted forward pass where we don't intervene, and (2) each corrupted forward pass where we do intervene on one of the heads. In other words, you'll need to save `(N_LAYERS * N_HEADS) + 1` tensors in total.

</details>

A few other notes:

* We've added a `layers` argument, so you can iterate through different layers of the model (i.e. running the model with `layers = [3, 4, 5]` will only test the intervention on the attention heads in layers 3, 4 and 5). This is helpful if you're getting memory errors when trying to run all layers at once (remember we have 24 layers, 16 heads per layer, so even with few prompts per head this adds up fast!).
    * We've included code for you below showing how you can call the function multiple times, clearing memory between each run, then combine the results.
* When it comes to intervening, you can set the value of a reshaped tensor, i.e. `tensor.reshape(*new_shape)[index] = new_value` will change the values in `tensor` without actually reshaping it (for more on this, see the documentation for [`torch.Tensor.view`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.view.html)).
* It's good practice to insert a lot of assert statements in your code, to check the shapes are what you expect.
* If you're confused about dimensions, use `einops.rearrange` rather than `.reshape` - it's like using code annotations within your actual code!

One last note - **if this function is proving impossible to run for computational reasons, you can skip the exercise and move on to the next ones. They don't rely on this function working.** However, you should definitely at least read & understand the solution.

As mentioned, the code below calls the function multiple times separately and combines the results.

When you run this code & plot the results, you should replicate Figure 3(a) in the Function Vectors paper (more or less). If the code is taking too long to run, we recommend just choosing a single layer to run, which has a distinctive pattern that can be compared to the paper's figure (e.g. layer 8, since head L8H1 has a much higher score than all the other heads in this layer).

```python
dataset = ICLDataset(ANTONYM_PAIRS, size=4, n_prepended=2)

def batch_process_layers(n_layers, batch_size):
    for i in range(0, n_layers, batch_size):
        yield range(n_layers)[i:i + batch_size]

results = t.empty((0, N_HEADS), device=device)

# If this fails to run, reduce the batch size so the fwd passes are split up more
for layers in batch_process_layers(N_LAYERS, batch_size=4):
    print(f"Computing layers in {layers} ...")
    t0 = time.time()
    results = t.concat([results, calculate_fn_vectors_and_intervene(model, dataset, layers).to(device)])
    print(f"... finished in {time.time()-t0:.2f} seconds.\n")

    
imshow(
    results.T,
    title = "Average indirect effect of function-vector intervention on antonym task",
    width = 1000,
    height = 600,
    labels = {"x": "Layer", "y": "Head"},
    aspect = "equal",
)
```

### Exercise - calculate the function vector

```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 25-50 minutes on this exercise.
```

Your next task is to actually calculate and return the function vector, so we can do a few experiments with it. The function vector is the sum of the outputs of all the attention heads we found using the previous function (i.e. the sum of all of the vectors these heads write to the residual stream), averaged over the prompts in our dataset.

There's a difficulty here - rather than just getting the `z` vectors, we're actually trying to get the `attn_out` vectors, but *before* they're summed over heads. As we discussed previously, this is a bit tricky to do for the model we're working with, because the `out_proj` linear map actually does the "project up" and "sum over heads" operations simultaneously. It would be nice to just take a slice of the `out_proj` matrix and multiply it with a slice of the `z` vector, but the `nnsight` library doesn't yet allow users to access weights directly (for security reasons). To understand how we can extract the `attn_out` vector for a head separately without accessing the underlying weights, you should go back to read the subsection **A note on `out_proj`** at the start of this section.

## Multi-token generation

We're now going to replicate some of the results in Table 3, in the paper:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/tab3.png" width="700">

This will involve doing something we haven't done before - **intervening on multi-token prompt generation**.

Most of the interpretability exercises in this chapter have just consisted of running single forward passes, rather than autoregressive text generation. But we're trying something different here: we're adding the function vector to the final sequence position at each forward pass during text generation, and seeing if we can get the model to output a sentence with a different meaning.

The results of Table 3 came from adding the function vector to the residual stream at the final sequence position of the original prompt, **and the final sequence position for each subsequent generation.** The reason we do this is to guide the model's behaviour over time. Our hypothesis is that the function vector induces "next-token antonym behaviour" (because it was calculated by averaging attention head outputs at the sequence position before the model made its antonym prediction in the ICL prompts).

### Using `nnsight` for multi-token generation

Previously, our context managers have looked like:

```python
with model.forward(remote=True) as runner:
    with runner.invoke(prompt) as invoker:

        # Do stuff to the model's internals
```

But for multi-token generation, we'll be using the `generate` method rather than `forward`. Our context managers will look like:

```python
with model.generate(max_new_tokens=max_new_tokens, remote=True) as generator:
    with generator.invoke(prompt) as invoker:

        for n in range(max_new_tokens):
            # Do stuff to the model's internals, on the n-th forward pass
            invoker.next()
```

The line `invoker.next()` denotes that the following interventions should be applied to the subsequent generations.

Mostly, everything you learned during single-token generation generalizes to the multi-token case. For example, using `.save()` still saves proxies outside the context managers (although make sure that you don't use the same variable names over different generations, otherwise you'll overwrite them - it's easier to store your saved proxies in e.g. a list or dict).

### Caching

One important concept we've left out of discussions so far is **caching**. To speed up inference, transformer models perform **key-value caching** to speed up text generation. This means that the time taken to generate $n$ tokens is ***much*** less than $n$ times longer than generating a single token. See [this blog post](https://kipp.ly/transformer-inference-arithmetic/) for more on transformer inference arithmetic.

When caching takes place, and we're doing causal interventions, we have to be careful that the caching won't override our causal interventions. Sometimes caching has to be disabled to make sure that our causal intervention works correctly. For example, if we wanted to perform the intervention "add the function vector to *only* the final sequence position of the prompt for each token we generate" then we'd have to disable caching (since previous forward passes would contain cached values where we intervened on a sequence position which is no longer the final sequence position). However, here we're performing the intervention "add the function vector to the final token of the original prompt, and to *all subsequent sequence positions*", meaning enabling caching (the default behaviour) will give us the right causal intervention.

(Note - if this seems confusing, please ask a TA or send a message in Slack.)

### Generator output

If you pass `remote_include_output=True` into the `generate` function, then outside the context manager you can access `generator.output`, which contains things like the token ID completions. 

Note that you can do this in the way we're used to (getting logits from the model's activations, then argmaxing to get token IDs). But in future exercises we'll experiment with different sampling methods than greedy sampling (which generate uses by default), so `generator.output` and argmaxing over logits will not be identical!

### Exercise - intervene with function vector, in multi-token generation

```c

You should now fill in the function `intervene_with_fn_vector` below. This will take a function vector (calculated from the function you wrote above), as well as a few other arguments (see docstring), and return the model's string completion on the given prompt template.

We hope to observe results qualitatively like the ones in Table 3, i.e. having the model define a particular word as its antonym.

```python
def intervene_with_fn_vector(
    model: LanguageModel,
    word: str,
    layer: int,
    fn_vector: Float[Tensor, "d_model"],
    prompt_template = 'The word "{x}" means',
    n_tokens: int = 5,

To test your function, run the code below. You should find that the first completion seems normal, but the second completion defines a word as its antonym. If this works, congratulations - **you've just successfully induced an OOD behavioural change in a 6b-parameter model!**

```python
# Remove "light" from our pairs, so it can be a holdout
word = "light"
_ANTONYM_PAIRS = [pair for pair in ANTONYM_PAIRS if word not in pair]

# Define our dataset, and the attention heads we'll use
dataset = ICLDataset(_ANTONYM_PAIRS, size=20, n_prepended=5)
head_list = [(8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 14), (11, 0), (12, 10), (13, 12), (13, 13), (14, 9), (15, 5), (16, 14)]

# Extract the function vector
fn_vector = calculate_fn_vector(model, dataset, head_list)

# Intervene with the function vector
completion, completion_intervention = intervene_with_fn_vector(
    model,
    word = word,
    layer = 9,
    fn_vector = fn_vector,
    prompt_template = 'The word "{x}" means',
    n_tokens = 40,
)

table = Table("No intervention", "intervention")
table.add_row(repr(completion), repr(completion_intervention))
rprint(table)
```

### Exercise - generalize results to another task (optional)

```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 20-45 minutes on this exercise.
```

In this exercise, you get to pick a task different to the antonyms task, and see if the results still hold up (for the same set of attention heads).

We'll leave this exercise fairly open-ended, without any code templates for you to fill in. However, if you'd like some guidance you can use the dropdown below.

<summary>Guidance for exercise</summary>

Whatever your task, you'll want to generate a new set of words. You can repurpose the `generate_dataset` function from the antonyms task, by supplying a different prompt and initial set of examples (this will require generating & using an OpenAI api key, if you haven't already), or you can just find an appropriate dataset online.

When you define the `ICLDataset`, you might want to use `bidirectional=False`, if your task isn't symmetric. The antonym task is symmetric, but others (e.g. the Country-Capitals task) are not.

You'll need to supply a new prompt template for the `intervene_with_fn_vector` function, but otherwise most of your code should stay the same.

<summary>Solution (for the country-capitals task)</summary>

```python
# I found using GPT4 directly was easier than using the API for this function. I took the output from GPT4

    COUNTRY_CAPITAL_PAIRS = [line.split() for line in f.readlines()]

# Remove (Netherlands, Amsterdam) from the pairs, so it can be a holdout
country = "Netherlands"
_COUNTRY_CAPITAL_PAIRS = [pair for pair in COUNTRY_CAPITAL_PAIRS if pair[0] != country]

# Define our dataset, and the attention heads we'll use
