# Model Setup & Linear Probes


> ### Learning objectives
> 
> - Understand the basic structure of the Othello-GPT model
> - See how our linear probe works



For those unfamiliar, Othello is a board game analogous to chess or go, with two players, black and white, see the rules outlined in the figure below. I found [playing the AI on eOthello](https://www.eothello.com/) helpful for building intuition. A single move can change the colour of pieces far away (so long as there's a continuous vertical, horizontal or diagonal line), which means that calculating board state is actually pretty hard! (to my eyes much harder than in chess)

## Background - Othello, and OthelloGPT


But despite the model just needing to predict the next move, it spontaneously learned to compute the full board state at each move - a fascinating result. A pretty hot question right now is whether LLMs are just bundles of statistical correlations or have some real understanding and computation! This gives suggestive evidence that simple objectives to predict the next token can create rich emergent structure (at least in the toy setting of Othello). Rather than just learning surface level statistics about the distribution of moves, it learned to model the underlying process that generated that data. In my opinion, it's already pretty obvious that transformers can do something more than statistical correlations and pattern matching, see eg [induction heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html), but it's great to have clearer evidence of fully-fledged world models!

For context on my investigation, it's worth analysing exactly the two pieces of evidence they had for the emergent world representation, the probes and the causal interventions, and their strengths and weaknesses.

### Probes

The probes give suggestive, but far from conclusive evidence. When training a probe to extract some feature from a model, it's easy to trick yourself. It's crucial to track whether the probe is just reading out the feature, or actually computing the feature itself, and reading out much simpler features from the model. In the extreme case, you could attach a much more powerful model as your "probe", and have it just extract the input moves, and then compute the board state from scratch! They found that linear probes did not work to recover board state (with an error rate of 20.4%): (ie, projecting the residual stream onto some 3 learned directions for each square, corresponding to empty, black and white logits). While the simplest non-linear probes (a two layer MLP with a single hidden ReLU layer) worked extremely well (an error rate of 1.7%). Further (as described in their table 2, screenshot below), these non-linear probes did not work on a randomly initialised network, and worked better on some layers than others, suggesting they were learning something real from the model.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nmxzr2zsjNtjaHh7x/b5rxfns1wxvsuomh1d79" width="550">

### Causal interventions

Probes on their own can mislead, and don't necessarily tell us that the model uses this representation - the probe could be extracting some vestigial features or a side effect of some more useful computation, and give a misleading picture of how the model computes the solution. But their causal interventions make this much more compelling evidence. They intervene by a fairly convoluted process (detailed in the figure below, though you don't need to understand the details), which boils down to choosing a new board state, and applying gradient descend to the model's residual stream such that our probe thinks the model's residual stream represents the new board state. I have an immediate skepticism of any complex technique like this: when applying a powerful method like gradient descent it's so easy to wildly diverge from what the models original functioning is like! But the fact that the model could do the non-trivial computation of converting an edited board state into a legal move post-edit is a very impressive result! I consider it very strong evidence both that the probe has discovered something real, and that the representation found by the probe is causally linked to the model's actual computation!




## Naive Implications for Mechanistic Interpretability

I was very interested in this paper, because it simultaneously had the fascinating finding of an emergent world model (and I'm also generally into any good interp paper), yet something felt off. The techniques used here seemed "too" powerful. The results were strong enough that something here seemed clearly real, but my intuition is that if you've really understood a model's internals, you should just be able to understand and manipulate it with far simpler techniques, like linear probes and interventions, and it's easy to be misled by more powerful techniques.

In particular, my best guess about model internals is that the networks form [**decomposable, linear representations**](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=KiDMIteKCEXt_EkR2sZCOfbG): that the model computes a bunch of useful features, and represents these as directions in activation space. See [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#motivation) for some excellent exposition on this. This is decomposable because each feature can vary independently (from the perspective of the model - on the data distribution they're likely dependent), and linear because we can extract a feature by projecting onto that feature's direction (if the features are orthogonal - if we have something like [superposition](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=3br1psLRIjQCOv2T4RN3V6F2) it's messier). This is a natural way for models to work - they're fundamentally a series of matrix multiplications with some non-linearities stuck in convenient places, and a decomposable, linear representation allows it to extract any combination of features with a linear map!

Under this framework, if a feature can be found by a linear probe then the model has already computed it, and if that feature is used in a circuit downstream, we should be able to causally intervene with a linear intervention, just changing the coordinate along that feature's direction. So the fascinating finding that linear probes do not work, but non-linear probes do, suggests that either the model has a fundamentally non-linear representation of features (which it is capable of using directly for downstream computation!), or there's a linear representation of simpler and more natural features, from which the probe computes board state. My prior was on a linear representation of simpler features, but the causal intervention findings felt like moderate evidence for the non-linear representation. And the non-linear representation hypothesis would be a big deal if true! If you want to reverse-engineer a model, you need to have a crisp picture of how its computation maps onto activations and weights, and this would break a lot of my beliefs about how this correspondance works! Further, linear representations are just really *convenient* to reverse-engineer, and this would make me notably more pessimistic about mechanistic interpretability working.


## Model


I'm of the opinion that the best way to become less confused about a mysterious model behaviour is to mechanistically analyse it. To zoom in on whatever features and circuits we can find, build our understanding from the bottom up, and use this to form grounded beliefs about what's actually going on. 

To get started, let's load in the model that we'll be using for this chapter. A few important technical details:

#### Vocab size & context window

Games are $60$ moves, but the model can only take in $59$. It's trained to predict the next move, so they give it the first $59$ moves ($0\leq...<59$) and evaluate the predictions for each next move ($1\leq...<60$). There is no Beginning of Sequence token, and the model never tries to predict the first move of the game. This is why `d_vocab = 61` (one per possible square you can play - an 8x8 board minus the middle 4 squares which are already occupied, plus one for the "pass" move) and `n_ctx = 59` (the context window length).

The vocabulary is denoted `A0, A1, ..., A7, B0, ..., H7` (with the letters referring to rows and numbers to columns), with the middle squares `D3, D4, E3, E4` being the occupied ones which aren't included in the vocabulary. The games with a pass are filtered out, so all games end after 60 moves.

There are three ways we can refer to board squares:

* `"label"` means the label for a square, e.g. `"A0"` or `"H7"`.
* `"int"` means "part of the model vocabulary", i.e. we count up from 1 to 60 for the squares in lexicographic order (skipping the 4 middle squares).
* `"string"` means "the input format of the `OthelloBoardState` class (see later for more on this). These are the integers from 0 to 63, with the middle squares *not* skipped out (so they exactly correspond to the 64 labels `A0, ..., H7`).

To convert between these representations, we have the utility functions `to_int`, `to_string`, `str_to_label` and `int_to_label` in `mech_interp_othello_utils.py`.

#### Parity

Black plays first in Othello. The input sequence to our transformer is a list of moves (black 1, white 1, black 2, white 2, ..., white 29, black 30). The output logits from our transformer represent its predictions for (white 1, black 2, white 2, ..., white 29, black 30, white 30).

#### Other files

Here are some more files, which we won't be using directly in these exercises, but you might still like to have a look at:

* `tl_probing.py` is my probe training file. But it was used to train a second probe, linear_probe_L4_blank_vs_color_v1.pth . This probe actually didn't work very well for analysing the model (despite getting great accuracy) and I don't know why - it was trained on layer 4, to do a binary classification on blank vs not blank, and on my color vs their color *conditional *on not being blank (ie not evaluated if blank). For some reason, the "this cell is my color" direction has a significant dot product with the "is blank" direction, and this makes it much worse for e.g. interpreting neurons. I don't know why!
* `tl_scratch.py` is where I did some initial exploration, including activation patching between different final moves.
* `tl_exploration.py` is where I did my most recent exploration, verifying that the probe works, doing probe interventions (CTRL F for `newly_legal`) and using the probe to interpret neurons.


```python
cfg = HookedTransformerConfig(
    n_layers = 8,
    d_model = 512,
    d_head = 64,
    n_heads = 8,
    d_mlp = 2048,
    d_vocab = 61,
    n_ctx = 59,
    act_fn="gelu",
    normalization_type="LNPre",
    device=device,
)
model = HookedTransformer(cfg)


sd = utils.download_file_from_hf("NeelNanda/Othello-GPT-Transformer-Lens", "synthetic_model.pth")
# champion_ship_sd = utils.download_file_from_hf("NeelNanda/Othello-GPT-Transformer-Lens", "championship_model.pth")
model.load_state_dict(sd)
```

Note - you uncomment the line above to load in the championship model instead (which was trained on championship games rather than synthetic ones).

```python
# An example input
sample_input = t.tensor([[
    20, 19, 18, 10,  2,  1, 27,  3, 41, 42, 34, 12,  4, 40, 11, 29, 43, 13, 48, 56, 
    33, 39, 22, 44, 24,  5, 46,  6, 32, 36, 51, 58, 52, 60, 21, 53, 26, 31, 37,  9,
    25, 38, 23, 50, 45, 17, 47, 28, 35, 30, 54, 16, 59, 49, 57, 14, 15, 55, 7
]]).to(device)

# The argmax of the output (ie the most likely next move from each position)
sample_output = t.tensor([[
    21, 41, 40, 34, 40, 41,  3, 11, 21, 43, 40, 21, 28, 50, 33, 50, 33,  5, 33,  5,
    52, 46, 14, 46, 14, 47, 38, 57, 36, 50, 38, 15, 28, 26, 28, 59, 50, 28, 14, 28, 
    28, 28, 28, 45, 28, 35, 15, 14, 30, 59, 49, 59, 15, 15, 14, 15,  8,  7,  8
]]).to(device)

assert (model(sample_input).argmax(dim=-1) == sample_output.to(device)).all()
```

## Loading Othello Content


```python
os.chdir(section_dir)

OTHELLO_ROOT = (section_dir / "othello_world").resolve()
OTHELLO_MECHINT_ROOT = (OTHELLO_ROOT / "mechanistic_interpretability").resolve()

if not OTHELLO_ROOT.exists():
    !git clone https://github.com/likenneth/othello_world

sys.path.append(str(OTHELLO_MECHINT_ROOT))
```

Note - you can access a larger dataset at the [GitHub readme](https://github.com/likenneth/othello_world), in the "Training Othello-GPT" section. There are links to download datasets from Google Drive (both synthetic and championship games). You can store them in your `data` folder, after you've cloned the repo using the code above.

```python
from mech_interp_othello_utils import (
    plot_board,
    plot_single_board,
    plot_board_log_probs,
    to_string,
    to_int,
    int_to_label,
    string_to_label,
    OthelloBoardState
)
```

We load in a big tensor of 100,000 games, each with 60 moves. This is in the format the model wants, with 1-59 representing the 60 moves, and 0 representing pass.

We also load in the same set of games, in the same order, but in "string" format - still a tensor of ints but referring to moves with numbers from 0 to 63 rather than in the model's compressed format of 1 to 59


```python
# Load board data as ints (i.e. 0 to 60)
board_seqs_int = t.tensor(np.load(OTHELLO_MECHINT_ROOT / "board_seqs_int_small.npy"), dtype=t.long)
# Load board data as "strings" (i.e. 0 to 63 with middle squares skipped out)
board_seqs_string = t.tensor(np.load(OTHELLO_MECHINT_ROOT / "board_seqs_string_small.npy"), dtype=t.long)

assert all([middle_sq not in board_seqs_string for middle_sq in [27, 28, 35, 36]])
assert board_seqs_int.max() == 60

num_games, length_of_game = board_seqs_int.shape
print("Number of games:", num_games)
print("Length of game:", length_of_game)
```

```python
# Define possible indices (excluding the four center squares)
stoi_indices = [i for i in range(64) if i not in [27, 28, 35, 36]]

# Define our rows, and the function that converts an index into a (row, column) label, e.g. `E2`
alpha = "ABCDEFGH"
    
def to_board_label(i):
    return f"{alpha[i//8]}{i%8}"

# Get our list of board labels

board_labels = list(map(to_board_label, stoi_indices))
full_board_labels = list(map(to_board_label, range(64)))
```

## Running the model


Let's run our model on the first 30 moves:


```python
moves_int = board_seqs_int[0, :30]

# This is implicitly converted to a batch of size 1
logits: Tensor = model(moves_int)
print("logits:", logits.shape)
```

We take the final vector of logits. We convert it to log probs and we then remove the first element (corresponding to passing, and we've filtered out all games with passing) and get the 60 logits. This is 64-4 because the model's vocab is compressed, since the center 4 squares can't be played.

We then convert it to an 8 x 8 grid and plot it, with some tensor magic:


```python
logit_vec = logits[0, -1]
log_probs = logit_vec.log_softmax(-1)
# Remove the "pass" move (the zeroth vocab item)
log_probs = log_probs[1:]
assert len(log_probs)==60

# Set all cells to -13 by default, for a very negative log prob - this means the middle cells don't show up as mattering
temp_board_state = t.zeros((8, 8), dtype=t.float32, device=device) - 13.
temp_board_state.flatten()[stoi_indices] = log_probs
```

<details>
<summary>Aside - how does this tensor magic work?</summary>

`temp_board_state` is an array of shape `(8, 8)`. When we use `.flatten()`, this returns a **view** (i.e. same underlying data) with shape `(64,)`. When we index it by `stoi_indices` (a list of 60 indices, which is all the indices excluding the "middle squares"), this also returns a view (still the same data). We can then set those 60 elements to be the model's log probs. This will change the values in the original tensor, without changing that tensor's shape.
</details>

We can now plot this as a board state! We see a crisp distinction from a set of moves that the model clearly thinks are valid (at near uniform probabilities), and a bunch that aren't. Note that by training the model to predict a *uniformly* chosen next move, we incentivise it to be careful about making all valid logits be uniform!


```python
def plot_square_as_board(state, diverging_scale=True, **kwargs):
    '''Takes a square input (8 by 8) and plot it as a board. Can do a stack of boards via facet_col=0'''
    kwargs = {
        "y": [i for i in alpha],
        "x": [str(i) for i in range(8)],
        "color_continuous_scale": "RdBu" if diverging_scale else "Blues",
        "color_continuous_midpoint": 0. if diverging_scale else None,
        "aspect": "equal",
        **kwargs
    }
    imshow(state, **kwargs)
    

plot_square_as_board(temp_board_state.reshape(8, 8), zmax=0, diverging_scale=False, title="Example Log Probs")
```

## Exploring Game Play


For comparison, let's plot the board state after 30 moves, and the valid moves.

A reminder about how parity works - blacks plays first, and so the 30th move is white's 15th move, hence we see white's last move in the plot below.

`plot_single_board` is a helper function to plot the board state after a series of moves. It takes in moves in the label format (i.e. A0 to H7) so we use the function `int_to_label` to convert. The colors represent the board state:

* Dark orange <font color='#CA562C'>▉</font> means a black piece
* Dark green <font color='#008080'>▉</font> means a white piece
* Mid orange <font color='#E6A272'>▉</font> is a legal next move for black
* Mid green <font color='#92B63A'>▉</font> is a legal next move for white
* The different shades of very pale colors indicate which of the previous moves would have been legal (don't worry about this)
* Red circle around a piece means "most recently played"
* Purple circle around a piece means "was just flipped by the most recent move"

Note that we don't see mid green <font color='#92B63A'>▉</font> in the plot below because the last move was white; if we plot the board state after an odd number of moves then we'd see this color.


```python
plot_single_board(int_to_label(moves_int))
```

## Making some utilities


At this point, I'll stop and get some aggregate data that will be useful later - a tensor of valid moves, of board states, and a cache of all model activations across 50 games (in practice, you want as much as will comfortably fit into GPU memory). It's really convenient to have the ability to quickly run an experiment across a bunch of games! And one of the great things about small models on algorithmic tasks is that you just can do stuff like this. 

Let's call these the **focus games**.


```python
num_games = 50
focus_games_int = board_seqs_int[:num_games]
focus_games_string = board_seqs_string[:num_games]
```

A big stack of each move's board state and a big stack of the valid moves in each game (one hot encoded to be a nice tensor):


```python
def one_hot(list_of_ints, num_classes=64):
    out = t.zeros((num_classes,), dtype=t.float32)
    out[list_of_ints] = 1.
    return out


focus_states = np.zeros((num_games, 60, 8, 8), dtype=np.float32)
focus_valid_moves = t.zeros((num_games, 60, 64), dtype=t.float32)

for i in (range(num_games)):
    board = OthelloBoardState()
    for j in range(60):
        board.umpire(focus_games_string[i, j].item())
        focus_states[i, j] = board.state
        focus_valid_moves[i, j] = one_hot(board.get_valid_moves())

print("focus states:", focus_states.shape)
print("focus_valid_moves", tuple(focus_valid_moves.shape))
```

To visualise this, let's plot the first 16 moves of the first game:


```python
imshow(
    focus_states[0, :16],
    facet_col=0,
    facet_col_wrap=8,
    facet_labels=[f"Move {i}" for i in range(1, 17)],
    title="First 16 moves of first game",
    color_continuous_scale="Greys",
)
```

Lastly, a cache of every model activation and the logits:


```python
focus_logits, focus_cache = model.run_with_cache(focus_games_int[:, :-1].to(device))
focus_logits.shape
```

## What is a probe?

From the [MI Dynalist notes](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#q=probe):

> **[Probing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01644.pdf)** is a technique for identifying directions in network activation space that correspond to a concept/feature.
> 
> In spirit, you give the network a bunch of inputs with that feature, and a bunch without it. You train a linear map on a specific activation (eg the output of layer 5) which distinguishes these two sets, giving a 1D linear map (a **probe**), corresponding to a direction in activation space, which likely corresponds to that feature.

Probes can be a very valuable tool to help us better understand the concepts represented in our model. However, there are two big caveats to keep in mind:

1. Probes give us a direction, but they don't give us a causal story about how that direction got into the model in the first place, or how the model is using that direction.
2. Probes (especially nonlinear probes) can be hiding a lot of computation under their surface.

In the original paper analysing Othello, the authors used nonlinear probing to find important directions. This went against a fundamental intuition - that models fundamentally store things in linear ways, and so we should be able to access them with linear probes. In these exercises, we'll be using linear probes.

## Using the probe

The training of this probe was kind of a mess, and I'd do a bunch of things differently if doing it again.

mode==0 was trained on black to play, ie odd moves, and the classes are \[blank, white, black\] ie \[blank, their colour, my colour\] (I *think*, they could easily be the other way round. This should be easy to sanity check)

mode==1 was trained on white to play, ie even moves, and the classes are \[blank, black, white\] ie \[blank, their colour, my colour\] (I think*)*

mode==2 was trained on all moves, and just doesn't work very well.


The probes were trained on moves 5 to 54 (ie not the early or late moves, because these are weird). I literally did AdamW against cross-entropy loss for each board cell, nothing fancy. You really didn't need to train on 4M games lol, it plateaued well before the end. Which is to be expected, it's just logistic regression!

</details>

But it works!

Let's load in the probe. The shape is `[modes, d_model, row, col, options]`. The 3 modes are "black to play/odd moves", "white to play/even moves", and "all moves" (note, when we say "odd moves" here we mean indexing from 1, since black moves first in Othello). The 3 options are empty, white and black in that order.

We'll just focus on the black to play probe - it basically just works for the even moves too, once you realise that it's detecting my colour vs their colour!

This means that the options we want in our `linear_probe` are "empty", "theirs" and "mine" in that order (rather than "empty", "black" and "white", which is what the original `full_linear_probe` had).


```python
full_linear_probe = t.load(OTHELLO_MECHINT_ROOT / "main_linear_probe.pth", map_location=device)

rows = 8
cols = 8 
options = 3
assert full_linear_probe.shape == (3, cfg.d_model, rows, cols, options)
```

```python
black_to_play_index = 0
white_to_play_index = 1
blank_index = 0
their_index = 1
my_index = 2

# Creating values for linear probe (converting the "black/white to play" notation into "me/them to play")
linear_probe = t.zeros(cfg.d_model, rows, cols, options, device=device)
linear_probe[..., blank_index] = 0.5 * (full_linear_probe[black_to_play_index, ..., 0] + full_linear_probe[white_to_play_index, ..., 0])
linear_probe[..., their_index] = 0.5 * (full_linear_probe[black_to_play_index, ..., 1] + full_linear_probe[white_to_play_index, ..., 2])
linear_probe[..., my_index] = 0.5 * (full_linear_probe[black_to_play_index, ..., 2] + full_linear_probe[white_to_play_index, ..., 1])
```

On move 29 in game 0, we can apply the probe to the model's residual stream after layer 6. Move 29 is black to play.

Let's see what the probe thinks about the board state, and compare this to the actual board state:


```python
layer = 6
game_index = 0
move = 29
    
def plot_probe_outputs(layer, game_index, move, **kwargs):
    residual_stream = focus_cache["resid_post", layer][game_index, move]
    # print("residual_stream", residual_stream.shape)
    probe_out = einops.einsum(residual_stream, linear_probe, "d_model, d_model row col options -> row col options")
    probabilities = probe_out.softmax(dim=-1)
    plot_square_as_board(probabilities, facet_col=2, facet_labels=["P(Empty)", "P(Their's)", "P(Mine)"], **kwargs)

    
plot_probe_outputs(layer, game_index, move, title="Example probe outputs after move 29 (black to play)")
    
plot_single_board(int_to_label(focus_games_int[game_index, :move+1]))
```

I got the best results intervening after layer 4, but interestingly here the model has *almost* figured out the board state by then, but is missing the fact that C5 and C6 are black and is confident that they're white. My guess is that the board state calculation circuits haven't quite finished and are doing some iterative reasoning - if those cells have been taken several times, maybe it needs a layer to track the next earliest time it was taken? I don't know, and figuring this out would be a great starter project if you want to explore!


```python
layer = 4
game_index = 0
move = 29

plot_probe_outputs(layer, game_index, move, title="Example probe outputs at layer 4 after move 29 (black to play)")
```

Now let's take one step forward - we should see that the representations totally flip. This is indeed what we find.


```python
layer = 4
game_index = 0
move = 30

plot_probe_outputs(layer, game_index, move, title="Example probe outputs at layer 4 after move 30 (white to play)")

plot_single_board(focus_games_string[game_index, :31])
```

Notice that the model gets the corner wrong in this case (incorrectly thinking that the corner is white rather than empty) - it's not a big deal, but interesting!

Can you think of a reason why corners might be treated differently in this model?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

One possible reason is to do with the rules of Othello, and how the corners have a special significance. What happens to a piece once it's placed in the corner?

</details>

<details>
<summary>One possible reason</summary>

A fact about Othello is that a piece in the corners can never be flanked and thus will never change colour once placed - perhaps the model has decided to cut corners and have a different and less symmetric circuit for these?

Trying to locate this circuit might be a fun bonus exercise!

### Computing Accuracy


Hopefully I've convinced you anecdotally that a linear probe works. But to be more rigorous, let's check accuracy across our 50 games.


```python
def state_stack_to_one_hot(state_stack):
    '''
    Creates a tensor of shape (games, moves, rows=8, cols=8, options=3), where the [g, m, r, c, :]-th entry
    is a one-hot encoded vector for the state of game g at move m, at row r and column c. In other words, this
    vector equals (1, 0, 0) when the state is empty, (0, 1, 0) when the state is "their", and (0, 0, 1) when the
    state is "my".
    '''
    one_hot = t.zeros(
        state_stack.shape[0], # num games
        state_stack.shape[1], # num moves
        rows,
        cols,
        3, # the options: empty, white, or black
        device=state_stack.device,
        dtype=t.int,
    )
    one_hot[..., 0] = state_stack == 0 
    one_hot[..., 1] = state_stack == -1 
    one_hot[..., 2] = state_stack == 1 
    
    return one_hot

# We first convert the board states to be in terms of my (+1) and their (-1), rather than black and white

alternating = np.array([-1 if i%2 == 0 else 1 for i in range(focus_games_int.shape[1])])
flipped_focus_states = focus_states * alternating[None, :, None, None]

# We now convert to one-hot encoded vectors
focus_states_flipped_one_hot = state_stack_to_one_hot(t.tensor(flipped_focus_states))

# Take the argmax (i.e. the index of option empty/their/mine)
focus_states_flipped_value = focus_states_flipped_one_hot.argmax(dim=-1)
```

Now we apply the probe to the residual stream at layer 6 (which involves taking a batch of dot products of `d_model`-length vectors):


```python
probe_out = einops.einsum(
    focus_cache["resid_post", 6], linear_probe,
    "game move d_model, d_model row col options -> game move row col options"
)

probe_out_value = probe_out.argmax(dim=-1)
```

The `probe_out_value` tensor tells us what the probe's prediction is for each `(game, move, row, col)`.

We can now compare this to the ground truth which we calculated in the previous cell. Note that we only use the middle moves `[5:-5]` because things get a bit messy outside this range.


```python
correct_middle_odd_answers = (probe_out_value.cpu() == focus_states_flipped_value[:, :-1])[:, 5:-5:2]
accuracies_odd = einops.reduce(correct_middle_odd_answers.float(), "game move row col -> row col", "mean")

correct_middle_answers = (probe_out_value.cpu() == focus_states_flipped_value[:, :-1])[:, 5:-5]
accuracies = einops.reduce(correct_middle_answers.float(), "game move row col -> row col", "mean")

plot_square_as_board(
    1 - t.stack([accuracies_odd, accuracies], dim=0),
    title="Average Error Rate of Linear Probe", 
    facet_col=0, facet_labels=["Black to Play moves", "All Moves"], 
    zmax=0.25, zmin=-0.25
)
```

Note that we can see the probe is worse near corners, as we anecdotally observed.


### Exercise - calculate probe cosine similarities

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

As another nice way of visualising how the "black to play" and "white to play" probes are similar, we can calculate the cosine similarity between each of the embedding vectors for both odd and even modes.

Try and replicate Neel's plot, which you can find at [this link](https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nmxzr2zsjNtjaHh7x/cuxy4pf353wazoq5emmn). You can see in this plot that the cosine similarities for the probe directions at odd and even moves are close to -1 (indicating that the probes are finding the right directions).

Remember, `full_linear_probe` has shape `(modes=3, d_model=512, rows=8, cols=8, options=3)`. The modes are black to play (odd) / white to play (even) / all, and the options are blank / black / white respectively. The plot we're trying to replicate has the cosine similarity of the probe direction at every square in the board, for odd and even modes (denoted with `(O)` and `(E)` in the reference plot).


```python
# YOUR CODE HERE - define the `cosine_similarities` tensor, to be plotted

imshow(
    cosine_similarities,
    title="Cosine Sim of B-W Linear Probe Directions by Cell",
    x=[f"{L} (O)" for L in full_board_labels] + [f"{L} (E)" for L in full_board_labels],
    y=[f"{L} (O)" for L in full_board_labels] + [f"{L} (E)" for L in full_board_labels],
)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


```python
odd_BminusW_probe = full_linear_probe[0, ..., 1] - full_linear_probe[0, ..., 2]
even_BminusW_probe = full_linear_probe[1, ..., 1] - full_linear_probe[1, ..., 2]
both_probs = einops.rearrange(
    t.stack([odd_BminusW_probe, even_BminusW_probe], dim=0),
    "modes d_model rows cols -> (modes rows cols) d_model"
)
both_probs /= both_probs.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
cosine_similarities = einops.einsum(
    both_probs, both_probs,
    "square_y d_model, square_x d_model -> square_y square_x",
)
```
</details>


## Intervening with the probe


One of the really exciting consequences of a linear probe is that it gives us a set of interpretable directions in the residual stream! And with this, we can not only interpret the model's representations, but we can also intervene in the model's reasoning. This is a good proof of concept that if you can *really* understand a model, you can get precise and detailed control over its behaviour.

The first step is to convert our probe to meaningful directions. Each square's probe has 3 vectors, but the logits go into a softmax, which is translation invariant, so this only has two degrees of freedom. A natural-ish way to convert it into two vectors is taking `blank - (mine + theirs)/2` giving a "is this cell empty or not" direction and `mine - theirs` giving a "conditional on being blank, is this my colour vs their's" direction.

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm confused by this.</summary>

If you've done the indirect object identification exercises, this is similar to looking at the `"John" - "Mary"` direction in the logit output - i.e. we take the difference between two logits, and this gets us the log-likelihood ratio between these two options.

It's slightly less principled when we're dealing with more than two different logits, because the nonlinearities get messy. However, using `blank - (mine + theirs)/2` is still a pretty reasonable metric:

* It's symmetric in `mine` and `theirs`,
* It's translation invariant (i.e. you could add a constant `c` onto all of `blank`, `mine` and `theirs` and it wouldn't change),
* If you increase `blank` by some amount `c` and keep the other two the same, then this metric also increases by `c`.

The `mine - theirs` direction is more principled.

</details>

Having a single meaningful direction is important, because it allows us to interpret a feature or intervene on it. The original three directions has one degree of freedom, so each direction is arbitrary on its own.


### Exercise - define your probe directions

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 5-10 minutes on this exercise.

The exercise isn't conceptually hard, understanding what the objects in question represent is the important part.
```


Define the tensors `blank_probe` and `my_prob`, which point in the two directions given above.

You should define these tensors from the `linear_probe` tensor (recall that this tensor has shape `[modes, d_model, row, col, options]`, where `options` indicates `blank/theirs/mine` - see the start of the section "Using the probe").


```python
# YOUR CODE HERE - define `blank_probe` and `my_probe`
tests.test_my_probes(blank_probe, my_probe, linear_probe)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


```python
blank_probe = linear_probe[..., 0] - linear_probe[..., 1] * 0.5 - linear_probe[..., 2] * 0.5
my_probe = linear_probe[..., 2] - linear_probe[..., 1]

```
</details>


Now that we've got our probe working, let's see it in action!

We'll take the 20th move in the 0th game as our example:


```python
pos = 20
game_index = 0

# Plot board state
moves = focus_games_string[game_index, :pos+1]
plot_single_board(moves)

# Plot corresponding model predictions
state = t.zeros((8, 8), dtype=t.float32, device=device) - 13.
state.flatten()[stoi_indices] = focus_logits[game_index, pos].log_softmax(dim=-1)[1:]
plot_square_as_board(state, zmax=0, diverging_scale=False, title="Log probs")
```

Now, how does the game state (i.e. which moves are legal for white) change when `F4` is flipped from black to white?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

One move becomes legal, one becomes illegal.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

`G4` becomes illegal, because you're no longer surrounding the vertical line of black pieces in column 4.

`D2` becomes legal, because now you'd be diagonally surrounding the single black piece at `E3`.

</details>

Let's verify this, using the `OthelloBoardState` class:


```python
cell_r = 5
cell_c = 4
print(f"Flipping the color of cell {'ABCDEFGH'[cell_r]}{cell_c}")

board = OthelloBoardState()
board.update(moves.tolist())
board_state = board.state.copy()
valid_moves = board.get_valid_moves()
flipped_board = copy.deepcopy(board)
flipped_board.state[cell_r, cell_c] *= -1
flipped_valid_moves = flipped_board.get_valid_moves()

newly_legal = [string_to_label(move) for move in flipped_valid_moves if move not in valid_moves]
newly_illegal = [string_to_label(move) for move in valid_moves if move not in flipped_valid_moves]
print("newly_legal", newly_legal)
print("newly_illegal", newly_illegal)
```

We can now intervene on the model's residual stream using the "my colour vs their colour" direction. I get the best results intervening after layer 4. This is a **linear intervention** - we are just changing a single dimension of the residual stream and keeping the others unchanged. This is a fairly simple intervention, and it's striking that it works!

I apply the fairly janky technique of taking current coordinate in the given direction, negating it, and then multiply by a hyperparameter called `scale` (scale between 1 and 8 tends to work best - small isn't enough and big tends to break things). I haven't tried hard to optimise this and I'm sure it can be improved! Eg by replacing the model's coordinate by a constant rather than scaling it. I also haven't dug into the best scale parameters, or which ones work best in which contexts - plausibly different cells have different activation scales on their world models and need different behaviour! 


### Exercise - define the `apply_scale` function

```yaml
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

Define a function which will take in the residual stream value and the associated hook point as arguments, and return a modified version of the residual stream, in the way described above.

To be clear, if we define $\vec{v}$ as the probe's flip direction for a given square (called `flip_dir` below), then we can write our residual stream (at `pos=20`, which is the one we're interested in) as the vector:

$$
\text{resid}_{20} = \alpha \times \vec{v} + \beta \times \vec{w}
$$

where $\vec{w}$ is some vector orthogonal to $v$. We want to alter the residual stream at this position to be:

$$
\text{resid}_{20} = - \text{ scale} \times \alpha \times \vec{v} + \beta \times \vec{w}
$$

Remember to normalize vector $\vec{v}$!


```python
def apply_scale(
    resid: Float[Tensor, "batch=1 seq d_model"],
    flip_dir: Float[Tensor, "d_model"],
    scale: int,
    pos: int
) -> Float[Tensor, "batch=1 seq d_model"]:
    '''
    Returns a version of the residual stream, modified by the amount `scale` in the 
    direction `flip_dir` at the sequence position `pos`, in the way described above.
    '''
    pass


tests.test_apply_scale(apply_scale)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


```python
def apply_scale(
    resid: Float[Tensor, "batch=1 seq d_model"],
    flip_dir: Float[Tensor, "d_model"],
    scale: int,
    pos: int
) -> Float[Tensor, "batch=1 seq d_model"]:
    '''
    Returns a version of the residual stream, modified by the amount `scale` in the 
    direction `flip_dir` at the sequence position `pos`, in the way described above.
    '''
    # SOLUTION
    flip_dir_normed = flip_dir / flip_dir.norm()

    alpha = resid[0, pos] @ flip_dir_normed
    resid[0, pos] -= (scale+1) * alpha * flip_dir_normed

    return resid
```
</details>


Now, you can run the code below to see the output of your interventions. You should see that the model's prediction changes from `F4` to `D2`!


```python
flip_dir = my_probe[:, cell_r, cell_c]

big_flipped_states_list = []
layer = 4
scales = [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16]

# Iterate through scales, generate a new facet plot for each possible scale
for scale in scales:

    # Hook function which will perform flipping in the "F4 flip direction"
    def flip_hook(resid: Float[Tensor, "batch=1 seq d_model"], hook: HookPoint):
        return apply_scale(resid, flip_dir, scale, pos)

    # Calculate the logits for the board state, with the `flip_hook` intervention
    # (note that we only need to use :pos+1 as input, because of causal attention)
    flipped_logits: Tensor = model.run_with_hooks(
        focus_games_int[game_index:game_index+1, :pos+1],
        fwd_hooks=[
            (utils.get_act_name("resid_post", layer), flip_hook),
        ]
    ).log_softmax(dim=-1)[0, pos]

    flip_state = t.zeros((64,), dtype=t.float32, device=device) - 10.
    flip_state[stoi_indices] = flipped_logits.log_softmax(dim=-1)[1:]
    big_flipped_states_list.append(flip_state)


flip_state_big = t.stack(big_flipped_states_list)
state_big = einops.repeat(state.flatten(), "d -> b d", b=6)
color = t.zeros((len(scales), 64)).to(device) + 0.2
for s in newly_legal:
    color[:, to_string(s)] = 1
for s in newly_illegal:
    color[:, to_string(s)] = -1

scatter(
    y=state_big, 
    x=flip_state_big, 
    title=f"Original vs Flipped {string_to_label(8*cell_r+cell_c)} at Layer {layer}", 
    # labels={"x": "Flipped", "y": "Original"}, 
    xaxis="Flipped", 
    yaxis="Original", 
    
    hover=[f"{r}{c}" for r in "ABCDEFGH" for c in range(8)], 
    facet_col=0, facet_labels=[f"Translate by {i}x" for i in scales], 
    color=color, color_name="Newly Legal", color_continuous_scale="Geyser"
)
```

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm still confused about this figure / this methodology.</summary>

When we mean "translating by `Nx`" for a scalar `N`, we mean "taking the component `x` of the residual stream in the `theirs - mine` probe direction for the F4 square, and replacing it with `Nx`. 

The scatter plots compare `-1x` (original) to `Nx` (flipped) for different values of `x`. For instance, the first facet plot shows what happens when the residual stream's component in the probe direction is erased.

The fact that we see the model's predictions for `G4` and `D2` change (with `G4` "becoming more illegal" and `D2` "becoming more legal") as our scale factor increases (without significant change in the predictions for other squares, at first) is evidence that our causal intervention is valid. In other words, the direction found by our linear probe `my_probe` does in some sense represent the model's `theirs - mine` direction, and this direction is used by the model downstream.

>     * Shape of logits is `(num_games=50, num_moves=59, d_vocab=61)` (59 because we never predict the first move, 61 because we have 60 moves + 1 for pass).
>     * This gives us 3000 moves in total.
> * **`full_linear_probe` - tensor containing all the directions found by the trained probe**
>     * Has shape `(mode=3, d_model=512, row=8, col=8, options=3)`.
>         * `mode` refers to the mode in which the probe was trained: "odd moves / black to play", "even moves / white to play", and all moves.
>         * `options` refers to the three directions: "blank", "theirs", "mine".
>     * In other words, the inner product of `linear_probe[-1]` along its first dimension with the residual stream at some position gives us a tensor of shape `(rows=8, cols=8, options=3)` representing the probe's estimate for the model's logprobs for the options "blank", "black", "white" respectively.
> * **`linear_probe` - same as above, except:**
>     * It only has one mode ("odd move / black to play")
>         * So shape is `(d_model=512, row=8, col=8, options=3)`.
>     * Options are "blank", "theirs", "mine" respectively (because this turns out to be how the model actually thinks about the game).

> New:
> 
> * **`blank_probe` and `my_probe` - tensors containing the important relative directions we care about in our analysis.**
>     * They were both created from linear combinations of the different **options** of `linear_probe`
>     * They both have shape `(d_model=512, row=8, col=8)`
>     * `blank_probe` represents the "blank direction" (which is `blank - 0.5 * theirs - 0.5 * mine`).
>     * `my_probe` represents the "mine - theirs direction" (which is `mine - theirs`).
>     * We can project residual stream vectors along these directions to get meaningful quantities (the model's "relative blank logprob", and "relative mine vs theirs logprob").
> * **`OthelloBoardState` is a class which is useful for creating board states over time.**
>     * You don't need to know how to use it; the code will always be given to you.
