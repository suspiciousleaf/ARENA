# Neuron Interpretability: A Deep Dive

> ### Learning objectives
> 
> - Learn techniques to deeply analyse single neurons
> - Use techniques like **max activating datasets** and **spectrum plots**, and understand their strengths and limitations


To practice neuron interpretability, let's take a deep dive into understanding this neuron - the techniques and code should transfer pretty well to any other neurons!

The spirit of this section is to practice doing various standard things that you could go and apply to another neuron in practice - I end it still being fairly confused, and with many dangling threads!


As above, we can use the probe weights to analyse its input weights. So we go in with the hypothesis that it detects `(C0==BLANK) & (D1==THEIRS) & (E2==MINE)`, and that it directly boosts the `C0` logit - this configuration means that `C0` must be legal, because it would flank `D1` along the diagonal!


## Direct logit attribution

We can also take the direct logit attribution of its output weights - ie `w_out @ W_U`, to see if the neuron significantly affects the output logits directly (like we did at the end of section 2Ô∏è‚É£).

Note that this is purely weights based analysis, we're not yet looking at actual model activations.

(Note on the code below - `.flatten()` returns a [view](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_view.html) of the `state` tensor, so we can fill in its values at `stoi_indices` (which is a list of indices between 0 and 63 inclusive, missing out the four middle squares) without actually reshaping the 8x8 tensor.)


```python
layer = 5
neuron = 1393

w_out = get_w_out(model, layer, neuron, normalize=False)
state = t.zeros(8, 8, device=device)
state.flatten()[stoi_indices] = w_out @ model.W_U[:, 1:]
plot_square_as_board(state, title=f"Output weights of Neuron L{layer}N{neuron} in the output logit basis", width=600)
```

Here we immediately see that boosting `C0` is an important part of what happens (which fits with our earlier hypothesis about the diagonal pattern which this MLP was picking up on), but that it also boosts `D1`, which is surprising! (`D1` is filled in our hypothesis, so must be illegal!)

One hypothesis is that the unembed for `C0` and `D1` are highly aligned, so it can't easily boost one but not the other.


### Exercise - compare the unembeds for C0 and D1

```yaml
Difficulty: üî¥üî¥‚ö™‚ö™‚ö™
Importance: üîµüîµ‚ö™‚ö™‚ö™

You should spend up to 5-10 minutes on this exercise.
```

Is this hypothesis true? Test it by calculating the cosine similarity of the `C0` and `D1` unembeds.

Recall, you can use the `to_int` helper function to convert a label like `"C0"` to an integer index (which you can use to index into the unembedding).


```python
# YOUR CODE HERE - calculate cosine sim between unembeddings

```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


You should see that the cosine similarity is close to zero, i.e. they're basically orthogonal. So this hypothesis is false! What else do you think might be going on here?

```python
c0_U = model.W_U[:, to_int("C0")].detach()
c0_U /= c0_U.norm()
d1_U = model.W_U[:, to_int("D1")].detach()
d1_U /= d1_U.norm()
rprint(f"Cosine sim of C0 and D1 unembeds: {c0_U @ d1_U}")

```
</details>


To check that this is a *big* part of the neuron's output, lets look at the fraction of variance of the output captured by the $W_U$ subspace.


### Exercise - compute fraction of variance explained by unembedding subspace

```yaml
Difficulty: üî¥üî¥üî¥‚ö™‚ö™
Importance: üîµüîµ‚ö™‚ö™‚ö™

You should spend up to 10-20 minutes on this exercise.

This might be a bit harder to understand conceptually, without a linear algebra background.
```

Note - when we say "fraction of a vector's variance explained by a subspace", this means the fraction of the original vector's squared norm which is represented by its projection onto the subspace. So if we have a vector $v$ and a subspace $W$ represented by a matrix of orthogonal row vectors, then $v^T W$ are the components of the projection of $v$ onto $W$, and the fraction of $v$'s variance explained by the subspace $W$ is $\|v^T W\|^2 / \|v\|^2$.

If you're confused by this, then you should go to the [How much variance does the probe explain?](#how-much-variance-does-the-probe-explain) section, where we do a computation which is similar to (but more complicated than) to the one which you should do now.

*Gotcha - remember to remove the 0th vocab entry from $W_U$ before taking SVD, since this corresponds to the "pass" move which never comes up in our data.*


```python
# YOUR CODE HERE - compute the fraction of variance of neuron output vector explained by unembedding subspace
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


You should find about 1/4 of the variance is explained. This is less than we might expect, and suggests that more might be going on here. Maybe the output of this neuron is used bu something else downstream before the unembedding is applied?

```python
w_out = get_w_out(model, layer, neuron, normalize=True)
U, S, Vh = t.svd(model.W_U[:, 1:])
print("Fraction of variance captured by W_U", (w_out @ U).norm().item()**2)

```
</details>


Another quick sanity check is just plotting what the neuron activations look like over the 50 games in our cache - we see that it only matters in a few games, and matters every other move (which makes sense for a feature denominated in terms of my vs their colours - this alternates every move as the colours swap!)


```python
neuron_acts = focus_cache["post", layer, "mlp"][:, :, neuron]

imshow(
    neuron_acts,
    title=f"L{layer}N{neuron} Activations over 50 games",
    labels={"x": "Move", "y": "Game"},
    aspect="auto",
    width=900
)
```

### Exercise - figure out what's going on with one of these games

Take one of the games where this neuron fires (e.g. game 5 seems like a good example). Plot the state of the game (using the monochrome `imshow`-based plots which we demo'ed at the start of this notebook).

<details>
<summary>Answer (for move 5)</summary>

Our neuron fires on moves 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20. By our theory, we expect to find that these are precisely the moves where `C0` is legal because it allows us to capture along the diagonal which contains `D1`.

```python
imshow(
    focus_states[5, :25],
    facet_col=0,
    facet_col_wrap=5,
    y=list("ABCDEFGH"),
    facet_labels=[f"Move {i}" for i in range(25)],
    title="First 16 moves of first game",
    color_continuous_scale="Greys",
    coloraxis_showscale=False,
    width=1000,
    height=1000,
)
```

This is exactly what we find. `C0` is a legal next move for the states labelled 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18. In all cases, it's white's move, and the legality is because `D1` is occupied by black and `E2` by white. Note that the `C0` square is legal in some other states (e.g. after move 22, when it's black's move), but we don't expect the neuron to fire in this case because the legality isn't because we can capture along the `C0-D1-E2` diagonal.
</details>


## Max Activating Datasets


Max activating datasets are a useful but also sometimes misleading tool we can use to better understand a neuron's activations. From my [Dynalist notes](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=pwjeUj-94p6EwwMO_41Kb3h1):

* **Max Activating Dataset Examples** aka **dataset examples** aka **max examples** are a simple technique for neuron interpretability. The model is run over a lot of data points, and we select the top K data points by how much they activate that neuron.
    * Sometimes there is a clear pattern in these inputs (eg they‚Äôre all pictures of boats), and this is (weak!) evidence that the neuron detects that pattern. Sometimes there are multiple clusters of inputs according to different patterns, which suggests that the neuron is **polysemantic** (i.e. it represents some combination of multiple different features).
    * This is a very simple and dumb technique, and has faced criticism, see e.g. [The Interpretability Illusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07143) which found that different datasets gave different sets of examples, each of which had a __different__ clear pattern.
    * See outputs of this for image models in [OpenAI Microscope](https://microscope.openai.com/) and language models in [Neuroscope](https://neuroscope.io/).

Doing this properly across many games is effort, but here we have cached outputs on 50 games (3000 moves), so we can look at the top 30 games there.


```python
top_moves = neuron_acts > neuron_acts.quantile(0.99)

focus_states_flipped_value = focus_states_flipped_value.to(device)
board_state_at_top_moves = t.stack([
    (focus_states_flipped_value == 2)[:, :-1][top_moves].float().mean(0),
    (focus_states_flipped_value == 1)[:, :-1][top_moves].float().mean(0),
    (focus_states_flipped_value == 0)[:, :-1][top_moves].float().mean(0)
])

plot_square_as_board(
    board_state_at_top_moves, 
    facet_col=0,
    facet_labels=["Mine", "Theirs", "Blank"],
    title=f"Aggregated top 30 moves for neuron L{layer}N{neuron}", 
)
```

Note that the blank cells show up with high frequency - this is one of the kinds of things [you have to watch out for](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07143), since exactly how you've defined your dataset will affect the features of the max activating dataset you end up finding.

We mostly care about the "mine vs theirs" distinction here because it's the most interesting, so let's create a new tensor where "mine" is `-1` and "theirs" is `+1`, then taking a mean over this tensor will give us an idea of "mine vs theirs".


```python
focus_states_flipped_pm1 = t.zeros_like(focus_states_flipped_value, device=device)
focus_states_flipped_pm1[focus_states_flipped_value==2] = 1.
focus_states_flipped_pm1[focus_states_flipped_value==1] = -1.

board_state_at_top_moves = focus_states_flipped_pm1[:, :-1][top_moves].float().mean(0)

plot_square_as_board(
    board_state_at_top_moves, 
    title=f"Aggregated top 30 moves for neuron L{layer}N{neuron} (1 = theirs, -1 = mine)",
)
```

We see that, for all moves in the max activating dataset, `D1` is theirs and `E2` is mine. This is moderately strong evidence that our neuron is doing the thing we think it's doing.


### Exercise - investigate more neurons

```yaml
Difficulty: üî¥üî¥üî¥‚ö™‚ö™
Importance: üîµüîµüîµüîµ‚ö™

You should spend up to 15-30 minutes on this exercise.

This exercise involves applying the same techniques you used above to other neurons, in a batched way.
```


Let's review the kinds of plots we've made during this section. There have been two kinds:

1. **Direct logit attribution plots**, where we calculated the cosine similarity of the corresponding neuron with the unembedding weights corresponding to each square.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/plottwo.png" width="950">

</details>

2. **Max activating dataset plots**, where we get a heatmap of how frequently a square was mine / theirs over the dataset we're choosing (where that dataset is the max activating dataset for some particular neuron).

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/plotone.png" width="750">
</details>

Try and make both of these plots, but for **all the top 10 neurons in layer 5** (where, like before, we measure "top 10" by the standard deviation of the neurons' activations, over all games and moves from the data in `focus_cache`). You'll be able to copy and paste some code from earlier.

We've given you the code for making the plots. All you need to do is calculate the `output_weights_in_logit_basis` and `board_states` tensors, which should be batched versions of the tensors which were used to generate the plots above (the 0th axis should be the neuron index, i.e. the `[0, ...]`-th slice of each of these tensors should be the things we fed into our plotting functions earlier in this section).

Can you guess what any of these neurons are doing? Does it help if you also plot some of them in the logit basis, like you did for `L5N1393`?


```python
# Your code here - investigate the top 10 neurons by std dev of activations, see what you can find!

plot_square_as_board(
    output_weights_in_logit_basis, 
    title=f"Output weights of top 10 neurons in layer 5, in the output logit basis",
    facet_col=0, 
    facet_labels=[f"L5N{n.item()}" for n in top_neurons]
)
plot_square_as_board(
    board_states, 
    title=f"Aggregated top 30 moves for each top 10 neuron in layer 5", 
    facet_col=0, 
    facet_labels=[f"L5N{n.item()}" for n in top_neurons]
)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
layer = 5
top_neurons = focus_cache["post", layer].std(dim=[0, 1]).argsort(descending=True)[:10]
board_states = []
output_weights_in_logit_basis = []

for neuron in top_neurons:

    # Get output weights in logit basis
    w_out = get_w_out(model, layer, neuron, normalize=False)
    state = t.zeros(8, 8, device=device)
    state.flatten()[stoi_indices] = w_out @ model.W_U[:, 1:]
    output_weights_in_logit_basis.append(state)
    
    # Get max activating dataset aggregations
    neuron_acts = focus_cache["post", 5, "mlp"][:, :, neuron]
    top_moves = neuron_acts > neuron_acts.quantile(0.99)
    board_state_at_top_moves = focus_states_flipped_pm1[:, :-1][top_moves].float().mean(0)
    board_states.append(board_state_at_top_moves)


output_weights_in_logit_basis = t.stack(output_weights_in_logit_basis)
board_states = t.stack(board_states)
```
</details>

How do you interpret the results?

<details>
<summary>Answer (a few examples)</summary>

Like the previous neuron, some of these should be interpretable. Examples:

* `L5N1406` - if `D4` is theirs and `D5` is blank, then this boosts the logits for `D5`.
* `L5N1985` - if `F4` is blank, and the opponents' pieces are adjacent to it, then this boosts the logits for `F4`.
</details>


## Spectrum Plots

One of the best ways to validate a hypothesis about neurons is to use a **spectrum plot**, where we plot a histogram of the neuron activations across the full data distribution (or at least some random sample) and categorise each activation by whether it has the property we think the neuron is detecting. We can do a janky version of that with the neuron's activations on our 50 games (plotting each histogram group as percent of the group size, to normalise for most games not having the configuration hypothesised).

Fascinatingly, we see that our hypothesis did *not* fully capture the neuron - almost every high activation had the hypothesised configuration, but so did some low ones! I'm not sure what's going on here, but it reveals a weakness of max activating dataset examples - they don't let you notice when your hypothesis allows false positives!

<details>
<summary>Question - can you explain why some of the activations are negative?</summary>

Remember we're using `GELU`, which can be negative.
</details>


```python
c0 = focus_states_flipped_pm1[:, :, 2, 0]
d1 = focus_states_flipped_pm1[:, :, 3, 1]
e2 = focus_states_flipped_pm1[:, :, 4, 2]

label = (c0==0) & (d1==-1) & (e2==1)

neuron_acts = focus_cache["post", 5][:, :, 1393]
    
def make_spectrum_plot(
    neuron_acts: Float[Tensor, "batch"],
    label: Bool[Tensor, "batch"],
    **kwargs
) -> None:
    '''
    Generates a spectrum plot from the neuron activations and a set of labels.
    '''
    px.histogram(
        pd.DataFrame({"acts": neuron_acts.tolist(), "label": label.tolist()}), 
        x="acts", color="label", histnorm="percent", barmode="group", nbins=100, 
        title="Spectrum plot for neuron L5N1393 testing C0==BLANK & D1==THEIRS & E2==MINE",
        color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Bold
    ).show()

make_spectrum_plot(neuron_acts.flatten(), label[:, :-1].flatten())
```

### Exercise - investigate this spectrum plot

```yaml
Difficulty: üî¥üî¥üî¥üî¥üî¥
Importance: üîµüîµüîµüîµ‚ö™

This is a very open-ended exercise, with no time estimates. You can come back to this at the end if you like.
```

Look at the moves with this configuration and low activations - what's going on there? Can you see any patterns in the board states? In the moves? What does the neuron activation look like over the course of the game?


### Exercise - make more spectrum plots

```yaml
Difficulty: üî¥üî¥üî¥üî¥‚ö™
Importance: üîµüîµüîµüîµ‚ö™

This is a very open-ended exercise, with no time estimates. You can come back to this at the end if you like.
```

Try to find another neuron with an interpretable attention pattern. Make a spectrum plot for it. What do you find?


### Recap of this section

In this section, we did the following:

* Used **direct logit attribution** to see how the output weights of neurons were affecting the output logits for each square.
    * Found `L5N1393` was boosting the logits for cell `C0`.
* Used **max activating datasets** to see which kinds of game states were causing certain neurons to fire strongly.
    * Found `L5N1393` was firing strongly when on the `(C0==BLANK) & (D1==THEIRS) & (E2==MINE)` pattern.
* Repeated these two plots for a bunch of other neurons, and found that lots of them were interpretable in similar ways (i.e. they all activated strongly on a particular pattern, and positively affected the logits for a square which would be legal to play in that pattern).
* Made a **spectrum plot**, and found that our explanation of the neuron wasn't the whole story (some game states with the given pattern *didn't* cause the neuron to fire).
    * This revealed a weakness with max activating datasets as a method of finding a full explanation of a neuron's behaviour.
