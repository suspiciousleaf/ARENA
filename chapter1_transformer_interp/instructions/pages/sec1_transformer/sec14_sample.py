# Sampling from a Transformer

> ### Learning objectives
>
> * Learn how to sample from a transformer
>     * This includes basic methods like greedy search or top-k, and more advanced methods like beam search
> * Learn how to cache the output of a transformer, so that it can be used to generate text more efficiently
>     * Optionally, rewrite your sampling functions to make use of your caching methods

One obvious method to sample tokens from a distribution would be to always take the token assigned the highest probability. But this can lead to some boring and repetitive outcomes, and at worst it can lock our transformer's output into a loop.

First, you should read HuggingFace's blog post [How to generate text: using different decoding methods for language generation with Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).

Once you've done that, you can work through the `TransformerSampler` class below, and implement the different sampling methods. Each method will come with its own tests, and demo code for you to run.


```python
model_cfg = Config()
model = DemoTransformer(model_cfg).to(device)
model.load_state_dict(reference_gpt2.state_dict(), strict=False)

tokenizer = reference_gpt2.tokenizer

class TransformerSampler:

    def __init__(self, model: DemoTransformer, tokenizer: GPT2TokenizerFast):
        self.model = model
        self.cfg = model.cfg
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer

    @t.inference_mode()
    def sample(self, prompt: str, max_tokens_generated=100, verbose=False, **kwargs):
        '''
        Returns a string of autoregressively generated text, starting from the prompt.

        Sampling terminates at max_tokens_generated, or when the model generates an
        end-of-sequence token.

        kwargs are passed to sample_next_token, to give detailed instructions on how 
        new tokens are chosen.

## Main Sampling Function

The first thing you should do is implement the `sample` method.

### Exercise - implement `sample`

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 20-25 minutes on this exercise.
```

This function takes in a prompt (in the form of a string), encodes it as a sequence of token ids using `self.tokenizer.encode`, and then continually generates new tokens by repeating the following steps:

1. Passing the tokenized prompt through the model to get logits,
2. Taking the logit vector corresponding to the last token in the prompt (i.e. the prediction for the *next* token),
3. Sampling from this distribution to get a new token, using `self.sample_next_token(input_ids, logits, **kwargs)` (here, `kwargs` contains all the sampling-specific arguments, e.g. temperature, top-k, etc.),
4. Appending this new token to the input tokens, and repeating the process until we meet one of two termination critera:
    * We generate `max_tokens_generated` new tokens, or
    * We generate the end-of-sequence token (which we can access via `self.tokenizer.eos_token_id`).

Finally, we use `self.tokenizer.decode` to convert the generated token ids back into a string, and return this string.

We also have a `verbose` argument - when this is true you can print your output while it's being sampled.

Below is some code which tests your sampling function by performing greedy sampling (which means always choosing the most likely next token at each step).

<details>
<summary>Why does <code>temperature=0.0</code> correspond to greedy sampling?</summary>

To apply a temperature to our sampling (as we'll see later) means to scale all logits by `(1 / temperature)`. The basic intuition here is:

* A higher temperature means a smaller scale factor, so the logits all approach zero, i.e. uniform distribution, and the sampling process is a lot more random (producing more diverse and varied outputs)
* A lower temperature means a larger scale factor, so the logits all approach infinity, i.e. a dirac delta function, and the sampling process is a lot more deterministic (producing less varied output)

As temperature gets close to zero, the difference between the largest logit and second largest logit becomes very large, so the distribution tends to "probability of 1 on the highest-likelihood token", i.e. greedy sampling. You can derive this formally if you prefer.
</details>

A few hints:

* Don't forget about tensor shapes! Your model's input should always have a batch dimension, i.e. it should be shape `(1, seq_len)`.
* The `sample_next_token` method will return an integer, so make sure you wrap this in a tensor before concatenating it to the end of your input IDs.
* Also remember to have your tensors be on the same device (we have a global `device` variable).
* Remember to put your model in evaluation mode, using `model.eval()`.

To be clear - the idea is for you to implement the `sample` method of the `TransformerSampler` class; you can do this by either editing the class definition directly or (if you want to avoid scrolling) define the `sample` function outside the class and then assign it via `TransformerSampler.sample = sample`.

```python
sampler = TransformerSampler(model, tokenizer)

prompt = "Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way"
print(f"Greedy decoding with prompt: {prompt!r}\n")

output = sampler.sample(prompt, max_tokens_generated=8, temperature=0.0)
print(f"Your model said: {output!r}\n")

expected = "Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way up to the top of the mountain."
assert output == expected

print("Tests passed!")
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
@t.inference_mode()
def sample(self, prompt, max_tokens_generated=100, verbose=False, **kwargs):
    # SOLUTION
    self.model.eval()
    input_ids = self.tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)[0]

    for i in range(max_tokens_generated):
        # Get new logits (make sure we don't pass in more tokens than the model's context length)
        logits = self.model(input_ids[None, -self.cfg.n_ctx:])
        # We only take logits for the last token, because this is what we're sampling
        logits = logits[0, -1]
        # Get next token (as a tensor of size (1, 1) so we can concat it to input_ids)
        next_token = t.tensor([TransformerSampler.sample_next_token(input_ids, logits, **kwargs)], device=device)
        # Create new input ids string, with shape (1, old_seq_len + 1)
        input_ids = t.cat([input_ids, next_token], dim=-1)
        # Print out results, if required
        if verbose:
            print(self.tokenizer.decode(input_ids), end="\r")
        # If our new token was the end-of-text token, stop
        if next_token == getattr(self.tokenizer, "eos_token_id", None):
            break
    
    return self.tokenizer.decode(input_ids)
```

</details>


## Sampling with Categorical

Now, we'll move into implementing specific sampling methods.

PyTorch provides a [`distributions` package](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributions.html#distribution) with a number of convenient methods for sampling from various distributions.

For now, we just need [`t.distributions.categorical.Categorical`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributions.html#categorical). Use this to implement `sample_basic`, which just samples from the provided logits (which may have already been modified by the temperature and frequency penalties).

Note that this will be slow since we aren't batching the samples, but don't worry about speed for now.


### Exercise - Basic Sampling

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 5-10 minutes on this exercise.
```

Implement basic sampling in the `TransformerSampler` class above, then run the code below to verify your solution works.


```python
prompt = "John and Mary went to the"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
logits = model(input_ids)[0, -1]

expected_top_5 = {
    " church": 0.0648,
    " house": 0.0367,
    " temple": 0.0145,
    " same": 0.0104,
    " Church": 0.0097
}
frequency_of_top_5 = defaultdict(int)

N = 10_000
for _ in tqdm(range(N)):
    token = TransformerSampler.sample_next_token(input_ids.squeeze(), logits)
    frequency_of_top_5[tokenizer.decode(token)] += 1

for word in expected_top_5:
    expected_freq = expected_top_5[word]
    observed_freq = frequency_of_top_5[word] / N
    print(f"Word: {word!r:<9}. Expected freq {expected_freq:.4f}, observed freq {observed_freq:.4f}")
    assert abs(observed_freq - expected_freq) < 0.01, "Try increasing N if this fails by a small amount."

print("Tests passed!")
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
def sample_basic(logits: t.Tensor) -> int:
    '''
    logits: shape (vocab_size, ) - unnormalized log-probabilities

    Return: a sampled token
    '''
    distribution = t.distributions.categorical.Categorical(logits=logits)
    out = distribution.sample().item()
    assert isinstance(out, int)
    return out
```
</details>


### Exercise - Temperature

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 5-10 minutes on this exercise.
```

Temperature sounds fancy, but it's literally just dividing the logits by the temperature. You should implement this in your `TransformerSampler` class now.


```python
logits = t.tensor([1, 2]).log()

cold_logits = TransformerSampler.apply_temperature(logits, temperature=0.001)
print('A low temperature "sharpens" or "peaks" the distribution: ', cold_logits)
t.testing.assert_close(cold_logits, 1000.0 * logits)

hot_logits = TransformerSampler.apply_temperature(logits, temperature=1000.0)
print("A high temperature flattens the distribution: ", hot_logits)
t.testing.assert_close(hot_logits, 0.001 * logits)

print("Tests passed!")
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
def apply_temperature(logits: t.Tensor, temperature: float) -> t.Tensor:
    '''
    logits: shape (vocab_size, )

    Return: shape (vocab_size, )
    '''
    assert temperature > 0
    return logits / temperature
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question - what is the limit of applying 'sample_basic' after adjusting with temperature, when temperature goes to zero? How about when temperature goes to infinity?</summary>

The limit when temperature goes to zero is greedy search (because dividing by a small number makes the logits very big, in other words the difference between the maximum logit one and all the others will grow). 

The limit when temperature goes to infinity is uniform random sampling over all words (because all logits will be pushed towards zero).")
</details>


### Exercise - Frequency Penalty

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µâšªâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

The frequency penalty is simple as well: count the number of occurrences of each token, then subtract `freq_penalty` for each occurrence. Hint: use `t.bincount` (documentation [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.bincount.html)) to do this in a vectorized way.

You should implement the `apply_frequency_penalty` method in your `TransformerSampler` class now, then run the cell below to check your solution.


<details>
<summary>Help - I'm getting a <code>RuntimeError</code>; my tensor sizes don't match.</summary>

Look at the documentation page for `t.bincount`. You might need to use the `minlength` argument - why?
</details>


```python
bieber_prompt = "And I was like Baby, baby, baby, oh Like, Baby, baby, baby, no Like, Baby, baby, baby, oh I thought you'd always be mine, mine"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(bieber_prompt, return_tensors="pt")
logits = t.ones(tokenizer.vocab_size)
penalized_logits = TransformerSampler.apply_frequency_penalty(input_ids.squeeze(), logits, 2.0)

assert penalized_logits[5156].item() == -11, "Expected 6 occurrences of ' baby' with leading space, 1-2*6=-11"
assert penalized_logits[14801].item() == -5, "Expected 3 occurrences of ' Baby' with leading space, 1-2*3=-5"

print("Tests passed!")
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
def apply_freq_penalty(input_ids: t.Tensor, logits: t.Tensor, freq_penalty: float) -> t.Tensor:
    '''
    input_ids: shape (seq, )
    logits: shape (vocab_size, )
    Return: shape (vocab_size, )
    '''
    (vocab_size,) = logits.shape
    id_freqs = t.bincount(input_ids, minlength=vocab_size)
    return logits - freq_penalty * id_freqs
```
</details>


### Sampling - Manual Testing

Run the below cell to get a sense for the `temperature` and `freq_penalty` arguments. Play with your own prompt and try other values.

Note: your model can generate newlines or non-printing characters, so calling `print` on generated text sometimes looks awkward on screen. You can call `repr` on the string before printing to have the string escaped nicely.


```python
sampler = TransformerSampler(model, tokenizer)

N_RUNS = 1
your_prompt = "Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way"
cases = [
    ("High freq penalty", dict(frequency_penalty=100.0)),
    ("Negative freq penalty", dict(frequency_penalty=-3.0)),
    ("Too hot!", dict(temperature=2.0)),
    ("Pleasantly cool", dict(temperature=0.7)),
    ("Pleasantly warm", dict(temperature=0.9)),
    ("Too cold!", dict(temperature=0.01)),
]

table = Table("Name", "Kwargs", "Output", title="Sampling - Manual Testing")

for (name, kwargs) in cases:
    for i in range(N_RUNS):
        output = sampler.sample(your_prompt, max_tokens_generated=24, **kwargs)
        table.add_row(name, repr(kwargs), repr(output) + "\n")

rprint(table)
```

## Top-K Sampling

Conceptually, the steps in top-k sampling are:
- Find the `top_k` largest probabilities (you can use [`torch.topk`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.topk.html))
- Set all other probabilities to zero
- Normalize and sample


### Exercise - implement `sample_top_k`

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µâšªâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 5-10 minutes on this exercise.
```

Implement the method `sample_top_k` now. Your implementation should stay in log-space throughout (don't exponentiate to obtain probabilities). This means you don't actually need to worry about normalizing, because `Categorical` accepts unnormalised logits.


```python
prompt = "John and Mary went to the"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
logits = model(input_ids)[0, -1]

expected_top_5 = {
    " church": 0.0648,
    " house": 0.0367,
    " temple": 0.0145,
    " same": 0.0104,
    " Church": 0.0097
}
topk_5_sum = sum(expected_top_5.values())

observed_freqs = defaultdict(int)

N = 10000
for _ in tqdm(range(N)):
    token = TransformerSampler.sample_next_token(input_ids.squeeze(), logits, top_k=5)
    observed_freqs[tokenizer.decode(token)] += 1

for word in expected_top_5:
    expected_freq = expected_top_5[word] / topk_5_sum
    observed_freq = observed_freqs[word] / N
    print(f"Word: {word!r:<9}. Expected freq = {expected_freq:.4f}, observed freq = {observed_freq:.4f}")
    assert abs(observed_freq - expected_freq) < 0.015, "Try increasing N if this fails by a small amount."
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
def sample_top_k(logits: t.Tensor, top_k: int) -> int:
    '''
    logits: shape (vocab_size, ) - unnormalized log-probabilities
    top_k: only consider this many of the most likely tokens for sampling

    Return: a sampled token
    '''
    top_logits, top_idx = t.topk(logits, top_k)
    idx = t.distributions.categorical.Categorical(logits=top_logits).sample()
    return top_idx[idx].item()
```
</details>


### Top-K Sampling - Example

The [GPT-2 paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) famously included an example prompt about unicorns. Now it's your turn to see just how cherry picked this example was.

The paper claims they used `top_k=40` and best of 10 samples.


```python
sampler = TransformerSampler(model, tokenizer)

your_prompt = "In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English."
output = sampler.sample(your_prompt, temperature=0.7, top_k=40, max_tokens_generated=64)
rprint(f"Your model said:\n\n[bold dark_orange]{output}")
```

This is pretty incredible! For some perspective on how much of a paradigm shift even basic models like this represented, we recommend reading [this section from Simulators](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx/simulators#The_limit_of_sequence_modeling). 

## Top-p aka Nucleus Sampling

The basic idea is that we choose the most likely words, up until the total probability of words we've chosen crosses some threshold. Then we sample from those chosen words based on their logits.

The steps are:

- Sort the probabilities from largest to smallest
- Find the cutoff point where the cumulative probability first equals or exceeds `top_p`. We do the cutoff inclusively, keeping the first probability above the threshold.
- If the number of kept probabilities is less than `min_tokens_to_keep`, keep that many tokens instead.
- Set all other probabilities to zero
- Normalize and sample

Optionally, refer to the paper [The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09751.pdf) for some comparison of different methods.


### Exercise - implement `sample_top_p`

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µâšªâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

<details>
<summary>Example of top-p sampling (if you're confused)</summary>

If our probabilities were `(0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)` and our cutoff was `top_p=0.8`, then we'd sample from the first three elements (because their total probability is `0.9` which is over the threshold, but the first two only have a total prob of `0.7` which is under the threshold). Once we've chosen to sample from those three, we would renormalise them by dividing by their sum (so the probabilities we use when sampling are `(4/9, 3/9, 2/9)`.

<summary>Help - I'm stuck on how to implement this function.</summary>

First, sort the logits using the `sort(descending=True)` method (this returns values and indices). Then you can get `cumulative_probs` by applying softmax to these logits and taking the cumsum. Then, you can decide how many probabilities to keep by using the `t.searchsorted` function.
    
Once you've decided which probabilities to keep, it's easiest to sample from them using the original logits (you should have preserved the indices when you called `logits.sort`). This way, you don't need to worry about renormalising like you would if you were using probabilities.

### Top-p Sampling - Example



```python
sampler = TransformerSampler(model, tokenizer)

your_prompt = "Eliezer Shlomo Yudkowsky (born September 11, 1979) is an American decision and artificial intelligence (AI) theorist and writer, best known for"
output = sampler.sample(your_prompt, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.95, max_tokens_generated=64)
rprint(f"Your model said:\n\n[bold dark_orange]{output}")
```

## Beam search

Finally, we'll implement a more advanced way of searching over output: **beam search**. You should read the [HuggingFace page](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate#beam-search) on beam search before moving on.

In beam search, we maintain a list of size `num_beams` completions which are the most likely completions so far as measured by the product of their probabilities. Since this product can become very small, we use the sum of log probabilities instead. Note - log probabilities are *not* the same as your model's output. We get log probabilities by first taking softmax of our output and then taking log. You can do this with the [`log_softmax`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.log_softmax.html) function / tensor method.


<details>
<summary>Log probabilities are equal to the logit output after being translated by some amount X (where X is a function of the original logit output). Can you prove this?</summary>

Suppose our vector of logits is $x$, and we take softmax to get a vector of probabilities $p$, then log again to get a vector of log probabilities $l$. Then the $i$-th element of this vector of logprobs is:

$$
\begin{align}
l_i &= \log p_i \\
&= \log \frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_j \exp(x_j)} \\
&= x_i - \log \sum_j \exp(x_j) \\
&= x_i - C
\end{align}
$$

where $C = \log \sum_j \exp(x_j)$ is the same for all elements. So we can see that $l_i$ is equal to the logit output $x_i$ after being translated by $C$.

It's important not to mix up logits and logprobs!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why do you think we use log softmax rather than logit output?</summary>

Logit output is translation invariant. If we had two different beams and we were generating the next tokens in those beams, there would be no reasonable way to compare the two beams to each other, because we could shift the logit vector for one beam by a constant amount without changing the distribution.

</details>


At each iteration, we run the batch of completions through the model and take the log-softmax to obtain `d_vocab` log-probs for each completion, or `num_beams * d_vocab` possible next completions in total.

If we kept all of these, then we would have `num_beams * d_vocab * d_vocab` completions after the next iteration which is way too many, so instead we sort them by their score and loop through from best (highest) log probability to worst (lowest).

The illustration below might help (based on real results from this method). Here, we have the following hyperparameters:

```python
num_beams = 3
max_new_tokens = 3
num_return_sequences = 2
```


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/beam-search.png" width="1000">


Note how after each "generate" stage, we have `num_beams ** 2` possible completions, which we then filter down to `num_beams`. Can you see why we need to generate this many (and what might happen if we generated fewer)?


How do we deal with sequences that terminate early (i.e. by generating an EOS token)? Answer - we append them to the list of completions which we'll return at the end, and remove them from the generation tree. Our algorithm terminates when either all our sequences have length `max_new_tokens` larger than the initial prompt length, or we've generated `num_returns_sequences` terminating sequences.


### Exercise - implement `beam_search`

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšª
Importance: ðŸ”µâšªâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 30-40 minutes on this exercise.
```

You should now complete the `beam_search` method in your `TransformerSampler` class.

We've provided one possible template for you to use: the class `Beams`, with important methods `generate` and `filter` for you to fit in (which correspond to the two stages in the diagram above). There are also a few of helper functions in this class:

* `new_beams`, which creates a new `Beams` object from an old one.
* `__getitem__`, which allows you to index into a `Beams` object to get a specific batch of beams.
* `logprobs_and_completions`, which turns a `Beams` object into a list of (logprob sum, string completion) tuples (useful for getting your final output).
* `print`, which prints out the current state of the beams (useful for debugging, if you run `beam_search` with `verbose=True`).

You can then fill in the `beam_search` function, using this class and its methods.

We've provided unit tests for the `generate` and `filter` functions, so you can verify that these are correct before moving on to the full `beam_search` function.

**Note that using the `Beams` class is not strictly necessary, you could fill in the `beam_search` function directly if you prefer.** The `Beams` class is just meant to provide one example way you might implement this function. Often, modular code like this is easier to write and debug, and easier to extend to cover new use cases (e.g. when we use caching in the bonus exercises).

#### Why all the n-gram repetition?

You should observe that, while the output of beam search is sometimes more fluent than some of the other sampling methods you implement, it also has an unfortunate tendency to repeat sentences or sequences. This makes sense - if the model produces a sentence with a relatively high logit sum, then it will want to produce the same sentence again even if it doesn't make a lot of sense in context.

A common solution is to ban repetition of n-grams. We've provided the argument `no_repeat_ngram_size` in the `generate` method for this purpose. Using this argument should prevent the model from repeating any n-grams of that size. Good values of this parameter to try are 2 or 3.

However, first you should focus on getting a working version of beam search *without* using this argument.

<details>
<summary>Hint (for <code>no_repeat_ngram_size</code>)</summary>

It might be helpful to implement the following method first. You can use this rather than `torch.topk` in your `generate` method.

def get_topk_non_repeating(
    self,
    logprobs: Float[Tensor, "batch d_vocab"],

    Returns:

Example usage of the `Beams` class, and the `print` method (not the logitsums aren't necessarily accurate, this example is just an illustration):


```python
beams = Beams(
    model, 
    tokenizer,
    logprob_sums = t.tensor([-10.0, -15.0, -20.0]).to(device),
    tokens = t.tensor([
        [5661, 318, 262, 2368],
        [5661, 318, 262, 1218],
        [5661, 318, 262, 717],
    ]).to(device)
)

beams.print()
```

And here are some unit tests for your `generate` and `filter` methods.

First, tests for `generate`:

```python
print("Testing generate, without no_repeat_ngram_size argument:")
new_beams = beams.generate(toks_per_beam=2)
new_beams.print()
assert new_beams.logprobs_and_completions[0][1] == "this is the third time"

print("Testing generate, with no_repeat_ngram_size argument:")
bigram_beams = Beams(
    model, 
    tokenizer,
    logprob_sums = t.tensor([-0.0]).to(device),
    tokens = t.tensor([[530, 734, 530, 734]]).to(device)
    # tokens are " one two one two"
)
    
# With no_repeat_ngram_size=1, should not generate the token " one" or " two"
new_bigram_beams = bigram_beams.generate(toks_per_beam=3, no_repeat_ngram_size=1)
new_bigram_beams.print()
assert all([not (completion[1].endswith(" one") or completion[1].endswith(" two")) for completion in new_bigram_beams.logprobs_and_completions])

# With no_repeat_ngram_size=2, it can generate " two" (which it should), but not " one"
new_bigram_beams = bigram_beams.generate(toks_per_beam=3, no_repeat_ngram_size=2)
new_bigram_beams.print()
assert all([not completion[1].endswith(" one") for completion in new_bigram_beams.logprobs_and_completions])
assert any([not completion[1].endswith(" two") for completion in new_bigram_beams.logprobs_and_completions])

print("All tests for `generate` passed!")
```

Now, tests for `filter`:

```python
logprob_sums = t.tensor([-1.0, -2.0]).to(device)
tokens = t.tensor([
    [19485, 13],
    [19485, tokenizer.eos_token_id]
]).to(device)

beams_with_eos = Beams(model, tokenizer, logprob_sums, tokens)
best_beams, early_terminations = beams_with_eos.filter(2)

t.testing.assert_close(best_beams.logprob_sums, logprob_sums[[0]])
t.testing.assert_close(best_beams.tokens, tokens[[0]])

assert early_terminations.logprobs_and_completions == [(-2.0, "Stop" + tokenizer.eos_token)]

print("All tests for `filter` passed!")

## Caching


*This section is also designed to be challenging, and take quite some time. There are many different ways to solve it, and you're expected to try and find your own way (you should think about this for a while before looking at the suggestions in the dropdowns). Additionally, you might not find it as interesting as some of the other sections. In this case, and if you have a lot of extra time, you might want to start on the "building BERT" exercises from this chapter.*


### How can caching help us?

The text generation we've done so far is needlessly re-computing certain values, which is very noticeable when you try to generate longer sequences.

Suppose you're generating text, and you've already run GPT on the sentence "My life motto:". Now you want to run the model on the sentence "My life motto: Always". Which computations from the first sentence can you reuse?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

At each attention layer, the only things the attention layer needs from the previous sequence positions are the key and value vectors. This is explained in the following diagram:

### Exercise - implement caching

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´
Importance: ðŸ”µâšªâšªâšªâšª

You are expected to spend well over an hour on this exercise, if you choose to do it.
```

Modify your GPT-2 to optionally use a cache. When you run your GPT on `"My life motto:"`, it should store the necessary values in the cache. Then in the next forward pass with just `" Always"` as input, it should load the cached values instead of recomputing them (and update the cache). This only needs to work with a single input sequence (batch size of 1), and you can assume that after the first forward pass, the input will be just one token.

The design of the cache is completely up to you - discuss possible designs with your partner before writing code. It should be possible to have only one GPT2 instance and many different cache instances at one time. Imagine that you want to use one instance to serve multiple users submitting requests for text generation like in [AI Dungeon](https://aidungeon.io/).

You'll also need to rewrite parts of your `DemoTransformer` code, in order to get this to work. The tests have been built to accommodate modules which return their output as the first element in a tuple (i.e. `(output, cache)`) rather than just returning the output, so you should use the tests to verify that your modules still work as expected.

Some example considerations:

* Which GPT-2 classes need to interact with the cache?
    * Will you need to change the positional embedding, and if so then how?
* Should the cache be mutable and be updated in place, or does updating actually just create a separate instance?
    * *(Hint here - think about how you might use the cache during beam search.)*
* Is it possible for other programmers to incorrectly use your cache? Is there a way to prevent this failure mode or at least detect this and complain loudly?

<summary>Cache implentation (example)</summary>

This KeyValueCache object is structured as just a fancy tensor (it inherits all the methods from Tensor). The main difference is that it has a few extra helper methods, e.g. constructing an empty cache from a Config object.

There are other ways you could do this, e.g. having your `KeyValueCache` class contain list of `KeyValueCacheEntry` objects (where each of these corresponds to a different layer).

```python
# Define a type for a single layer's cache entry (useful for type checking in later functions)
KeyValueCacheTensor = Float[Tensor, "2 batch seq_len n_heads d_head"]

class KeyValueCache(Tensor):
    '''
    This class holds tensors of key and value vectors, to be used for caching.

    If we define it using cfg and batch then it's initialized as empty, but
    we can also define it from kv_cache_entries.
    '''
    @classmethod
    def new_empty(cls, cfg: Config, batch: int = 1) -> "KeyValueCache":
        '''
        Doing a forward pass on a cache created in this way indicates "we don't
        yet have a cache, but we want this forward pass to return a cache".
        Whereas using cache=None in a forward pass indicates we don't want to 
        return a cache.
        '''
        shape = (cfg.n_layers, 2, batch, 0, cfg.n_heads, cfg.d_head)
        return cls(*shape).to(device)

    # Define a handful of properties, so they can be referenced directly rather than
    # indexing (which is more likely to lead to mistakes)

    @property
    def k(self) -> Tensor:
        return self[:, 0]

    @property
    def v(self) -> Tensor:
        return self[:, 1]

    @property
    def batch(self) -> int:
        return self.shape[2]
    
    @property
    def seq_len(self) -> int:
        return self.shape[3]


# Example implementation:
cfg = model.cfg
batch = 6
kv_cache = KeyValueCache.new_empty(cfg, batch)

print(f"Shape of all kv-cache = {tuple(kv_cache.shape)}")
print(f"Shape of just k-cache = {tuple(kv_cache.k.shape)}")
for kv_cache_entry in kv_cache:
    print(f"Shape of cache entry for one layer = {tuple(kv_cache_entry.shape)}")
    break
print(f"Batch size = {kv_cache.batch}")

You may find that your cache implementation provides a modest speedup, but probably not close to the `seq_len`-factor speedup you'd expect from the fact that you only compute one additional token at each step rather than all of them. Why is this? The answer is that, much like everything to do with computational and memory costs in deep learning, it's not so simple. There are a host of different factors which might be bottlenecking our model's forward pass speed. If you try this on the CPU, you should get a much more noticeable speedup.

For a bit more on these topics, see [here](https://kipp.ly/blog/transformer-inference-arithmetic/#kv-cache).


## Bonus - cached beam search

Can you modify your beam search function to use caching?

Depending on how you implemented your cache earlier, you might find that a different form of caching is better suited to beam search.

Again, we've provided an example implementation in a dropdown below, which is based on the cache implementation above and the previous solution for `beam_search`.
