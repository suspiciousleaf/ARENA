# Training a Transformer

> ### Learning objectives
>
> * Understand how to train a transformer from scratch
> * Write a basic transformer training loop
> * Interpret the transformer's falling cross entropy loss with reference to features of the training data (e.g. bigram frequencies)

Now that we've built our transformer, and verified that it performs as expected when we load in weights, let's try training it from scratch!

This is a lightweight demonstration of how you can actually train your own GPT-2 with this code! Here we train a tiny model on a tiny dataset, but it's fundamentally the same code for training a larger/more real model (though you'll need beefier GPUs and data parallelism to do it remotely efficiently, and fancier parallelism for much bigger ones).

For our purposes, we'll train 2L 4 heads per layer model, with context length 256, for 10*200 steps of batch size 16, just to show what it looks like (and so the notebook doesn't melt your colab / machine!).


## Create Model

```python
model_cfg = Config(
    debug=False, 
    d_model=256, 
    n_heads=4, 
    d_head=64, 
    d_mlp=1024, 
    n_layers=2, 
    n_ctx=256, 
    d_vocab=reference_gpt2.cfg.d_vocab
)
model = DemoTransformer(model_cfg)
```

## Training Args

Note, for this optimization we'll be using **weight decay**.

```python
@dataclass
class TransformerTrainingArgs():
    batch_size = 16
    epochs = 10
    max_steps_per_epoch = 200
    lr = 1e-3
    weight_decay = 1e-2
    wandb_project: Optional[str] = "day1-demotransformer"
    wandb_name: Optional[str] = None

args = TransformerTrainingArgs()
```

## Create Data

We load in a tiny dataset made by Neel Nanda, with the first 10K entries in the Pile (inspired by Stas' version for OpenWebText!)

```python
dataset = datasets.load_dataset("NeelNanda/pile-10k", split="train").remove_columns("meta")
print(dataset)
print(dataset[0]['text'][:100])
```

`tokenize_and_concatenate` is a useful function which takes our dataset of strings, and returns a dataset of token IDs ready to feed into the model. We then create a dataloader from this tokenized dataset. The useful method `train_test_split` can give us a training and testing set.


```python
tokenized_dataset = tokenize_and_concatenate(dataset, reference_gpt2.tokenizer, streaming=False, max_length=model.cfg.n_ctx, column_name="text", add_bos_token=True, num_proc=4)
    
dataset_dict = tokenized_dataset.train_test_split(test_size=1000)
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset_dict["train"], batch_size=args.batch_size, shuffle=True, num_workers=4, pin_memory=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(dataset_dict["test"], batch_size=args.batch_size, shuffle=False, num_workers=4, pin_memory=True)
```

When we iterate through these dataloaders, we will find dictionaries with the single key `'tokens'`, which maps to a tensor of token IDs with shape `(batch, seq_len)`.


```python
first_batch = train_loader.dataset[:args.batch_size]

print(first_batch.keys())
print(first_batch['tokens'].shape)
```

## Training Loop

If you did the material on [training loops](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#training-loop) during the first week, this should all be familiar to you. If not, you can skim that section for an overview of the key concepts. The start of the **Training loop** section is most important, and the subsections on [Modularisation](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#modularisation) and [dataclasses](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#aside-dataclasses) are also very useful. Lastly, we'll also be using Weights and Biases to train our model - you can read about how to use it [here](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.4]_Optimization#what-is-weights-and-biases). Here are (roughly) all the things you should know for the following exercises:
                
* The key parts of a gradient update step are:
    * Calculating the (cross-entropy) loss between a model's output and the true labels,
    * `loss.backward()` - calculate gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters,
    * `optimizer.step()` - update the model parameters using the gradients,
    * `optimizer.zero_grad()` - zero the gradients so they don't accumulate.
* We can nicely package up training loops into a class, which includes methods for training and validation steps among other things. This helps with writing code that can be reused in different contexts.
* We can use dataclasses to store all the arguments relevant to training in one place, and then pass them to our trainer class. Autocompletion is one nice bonus of this!
    * Be careful of scope here, you want to make sure you're referring to `self.args` within the trainer class, rather than the global `args`.
* You can use Weights and Biases to track experiments and log relevant variables. The three essential functions are:
    * `wandb.init()` - initialize a new run, takes arguments `project`, `name` and `config` (among others).
    * `wandb.log()` - log a dictionary of variables, e.g. `{"loss": loss}`. Also takes a `step` argument.
    * `wandb.finish()` - called at the end of training (no arguments).

### Exercise - write training loop

```yaml
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšª

You should spend up to 10-20 minutes on this exercise.
```

You should fill in the methods below. Some guidance:

* Remember we were able to calculate cross entropy loss using the `get_log_probs` function in the previous section.
* You should use the optimizer `t.optim.AdamW` (Adam with weight decay), and with hyperparameters `lr` and `weight_decay` taken from your `TransformerTrainingArgs` dataclass instance.
* The easiest way to compute accuracy is to have the `validation_step` method return a 1D boolean tensor indicating the positions where the model's prediction was correct. Then you can concatenate all these tensors together and take the mean to get the overall accuracy for the epoch.
* We've given you the argument `max_steps_per_epoch`, a hacky way of making sure the training phase in each epoch doesn't go on for too long. You can terminate each training phase after this many steps.
* Remember to move tokens to your device, via `tokens.to(device)` (this should be a global variable, defined at the top of your notebook).
* You can refer back to the training loops from the [previous chapter of the course](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#training-loop) if you'd like.

When you run the code for the first time, you'll have to login to Weights and Biases, and paste an API key into VSCode. After this is done, your Weights and Biases training run will start. It'll give you a lot of output text, one line of which will look like:

```
View run at https://wandb.ai/<USERNAME>/<PROJECT-NAME>/runs/<RUN-NAME>
```

which you can click on to visit the run page.

> Note - to see the plots more clearly in Weights and Biases, you can click on the **edit panel** of your plot (the small pencil symbol at the top-right), then move the **smoothing** slider to the right.

### A note on this loss curve (optional)

What's up with the shape of our loss curve? It seems like we start at around 10-11, drops down very fast, but then levels out. It turns out, this is all to do with the kinds of algorithms the model learns during training.

When it starts out, your model will be outputting random noise, which might look a lot like "predict each token with approximately uniform probability", i.e. $Q(x) = 1/d_\text{vocab}$ for all $x$. This gives us a cross entropy loss of $\log (d_\text{vocab})$.


```python
d_vocab = model.cfg.d_vocab

print(f"d_vocab = {d_vocab}")
print(f"Cross entropy loss on uniform distribution = {math.log(d_vocab)}")
```

The next thing we might expect the model to learn is the frequencies of words in the english language. After all, small common tokens like `" and"` or `" the"` might appear much more frequently than others. This would give us an average cross entropy loss of:

$$
- \sum_x p_x \log p_x
$$

where $p_x$ is the actual frequency of the word in our training data.

We can evaluate this quantity as follows:

```python
toks = tokenized_dataset[:]["tokens"].flatten()

d_vocab = model.cfg.d_vocab
freqs = t.bincount(toks, minlength=d_vocab)
probs = freqs.float() / freqs.sum()

distn = t.distributions.categorical.Categorical(probs=probs)
entropy = distn.entropy()

print(f"Entropy of training data = {entropy}")
```

After unigram frequencies, the next thing our model usually learns is **bigram frequencies** (i.e. the frequency of pairs of adjacent tokens in the training data). For instance, `"I"` and `" am"` are common tokens, but their bigram frequency is much higher than it would be if they occurred independently. Bigram frequencies actually take you pretty far, since they also help with:

* Some simple grammatical rules (e.g. a full stop being followed by a capitalized word)
* Weird quirks of tokenization (e.g. `" manip"` being followed by `"ulative"`)
* Common names (e.g. `"Barack"` being followed by `" Obama"`)

After approximating bigram frequencies, we need to start using smarter techniques, like trigrams (which can only be implemented using attention heads), **induction heads** (which we'll learn a lot more about in the next set of exercises!), and fact memorization or more basic grammar and syntax rules. Marginal improvement starts getting a lot harder around here, leading to a flattening of our loss curve.

### Exercise (optional) - log completions

*Note - you might want to come back to this exercise after you understand how sampling works.*

Choose a handle of prompts, and log the model's completions on those sentences. We recommend you do this with a lower frequency than loss is logged (e.g. once every 10-100 batches). 

The `wandb` syntax for logging text is pretty simple. Firstly, you can just print output as stdout and this is also logged to Weights & Biases (you can find it under the "Logs" section of your run). Alternatively, you can log data in the form of a table, and have it appear next to your other charts:

```python
wandb.log({"completions_table": wandb.Table(
    data = data,
    columns = ["epoch", "step", "text"]
)})
```

where `data` is a list of length-3 lists, with each list containing (epoch, step, text). If you choose this option, we recommend logging the table less frequently than you're sampling from the model, to make sure you're not sending too much data (because unfortunately wandb doesn't have methods to incrementally update the table during logging).

If you want to try this before going through the sampling exercises (which are quite long!), you can use the code below to sample output from the model. Note that the `TransformerSampler` object is already in inference mode, so you don't need to worry about this. 

```python
def sampling_fn(model: DemoTransformer, prompt: str) -> str:
    sampler = solutions.TransformerSampler(model, reference_gpt2.tokenizer)
    output = sampler.sample(prompt, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.95, max_tokens_generated=16)
    return output

model = DemoTransformer(model_cfg).to(device)

# Should be entirely random, because it uses a newly initialized model
print(sampling_fn(model, prompt="John and Mary went to the"))
```

Read the training report I generated [here](https://api.wandb.ai/links/callum-mcdougall/5ex16e5w). Note that it's possible a better choice of prompts would have done a better job demonstrating the model's growing capabilities.

You shouldn't expect to see perfect logical coherence from your model, but you should at least see that it respects basic word frequencies, and follows basic rules of grammar some of the time. Hopefully this gives some perspective on how difficult training a transformer can be!
