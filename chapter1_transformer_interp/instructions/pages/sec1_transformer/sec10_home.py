## Introduction

This is a clean, first principles implementation of GPT-2 in PyTorch. The architectural choices closely follow those used by the TransformerLens library (which you'll be using a lot more in later exercises).

The exercises are written to accompany Neel Nanda's [TransformerLens library](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) for doing mechanistic interpretability research on GPT-2 style language models. We'll be working with this library extensively in this chapter of the course.

Each exercise will have a difficulty and importance rating out of 5, as well as an estimated maximum time you should spend on these exercises and sometimes a short annotation. You should interpret the ratings & time estimates relatively (e.g. if you find yourself spending about 50% longer on the exercises than the time estimates, adjust accordingly). Please do skip exercises / look at solutions if you don't feel like they're important enough to be worth doing, and you'd rather get to the good stuff!

## Content & Learning Objectives


#### 1️⃣ Understanding Inputs & Outputs of a Transformer

In this section, we'll take a first look at transformers - what their function is, how information moves inside a transformer, and what inputs & outputs they take.

> ##### Learning objectives
> 
> - Understand what a transformer is used for
> - Understand causal attention, and what a transformer's output representsalgebra operations on tensors
> - Learn what tokenization is, and how models do it
> - Understand what logits are, and how to use them to derive a probability distribution over the vocabulary

#### 2️⃣ Clean Transformer Implementation

Here, we'll implement a transformer from scratch, using only PyTorch's tensor operations. This will give us a good understanding of how transformers work, and how to use them. We do this by going module-by-module, in an experience which should feel somewhat similar to last week's ResNet exercises. Much like with ResNets, you'll conclude by loading in pretrained weights and verifying that your model works as expected.

> ##### Learning objectives
> 
> * Understand that a transformer is composed of attention heads and MLPs, with each one performing operations on the residual stream
> * Understand that the attention heads in a single layer operate independently, and that they have the role of calculating attention patterns (which determine where information is moved to & from in the residual stream)
> * Learn about & implement the following transformer modules:
>     * LayerNorm (transforming the input to have zero mean and unit variance)
>     * Positional embedding (a lookup table from position indices to residual stream vectors)
>     * Attention (the method of computing attention patterns for residual stream vectors)
>     * MLP (the collection of linear and nonlinear transformations which operate on each residual stream vector in the same way)
>     * Embedding (a lookup table from tokens to residual stream vectors)
>     * Unembedding (a matrix for converting residual stream vectors into a distribution over tokens)

#### 3️⃣ Training a Transformer

Next, you'll learn how to train your transformer from scratch. This will be quite similar to the training loops you wrote for ResNet in your first week.

> ##### Learning objectives
>
> * Understand how to train a transformer from scratch
> * Write a basic transformer training loop
> * Interpret the transformer's falling cross entropy loss with reference to features of the training data (e.g. bigram frequencies)

#### 4️⃣ Sampling from a Transformer

Lastly, you'll learn how to sample from a transformer. This will involve implementing a few different sampling methods, and writing a caching system which can reuse computations from previous forward passes to improve your model's text generation speed.

*The second half of this section is less important, and you can skip it if you want. The percentage estimates given on the left-hand sidebar are only for the first half of these exercises, not all of them. The true percentages might be different if you do more / less of these exercises.*

> ##### Learning objectives
>
> * Learn how to sample from a transformer
>     * This includes basic methods like greedy search or top-k, and more advanced methods like beam search
> * Learn how to cache the output of a transformer, so that it can be used to generate text more efficiently
>     * Optionally, rewrite your sampling functions to make use of your caching methods

## Setup

```python
import os; os.environ['ACCELERATE_DISABLE_RICH'] = "1"
import sys
import einops
from dataclasses import dataclass
from transformer_lens import HookedTransformer
from transformer_lens.utils import gelu_new, tokenize_and_concatenate

from jaxtyping import Float, Int
from transformers.models.gpt2.tokenization_gpt2_fast import GPT2TokenizerFast
from collections import defaultdict
from rich.table import Table

import wandb
from pathlib import Path
import webbrowser

# Make sure exercises are in the path
chapter = r"chapter1_transformer_interp"
exercises_dir = Path(f"{os.getcwd().split(chapter)[0]}/{chapter}/exercises").resolve()
section_dir = exercises_dir / "part1_transformer_from_scratch"
if str(exercises_dir) not in sys.path: sys.path.append(str(exercises_dir))

from plotly_utils import imshow
import part1_transformer_from_scratch.solutions as solutions

device = t.device("cuda" if t.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

MAIN = __name__ == '__main__'

reference_gpt2 = HookedTransformer.from_pretrained(
    "gpt2-small",
    fold_ln=False,
    center_unembed=False,
    center_writing_weights=False,
)
```
                
## Note on Mac setup
                
Using the correct `device` variable on MacOS can be quite difficult, and the same code that we've provided above might not work for you. You might instead want to use `torch.device("mps")` if it is available. See [these](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/mps.html) [two](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) links for more information on using PyTorch on Mac devices. If you have any other problems or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us.
